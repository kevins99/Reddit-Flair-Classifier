I think it's a well known, well documented reality of our times that work balance life is highly trash in India.

Work environments are largely toxic too due to a culmination of many internal & external factors.

The commute eats into a substantial time of the day for most folks as well on top of this. 

Are there any organizations in India who have already implemented a 4 day week - or are such plans in the pipeline for companies?

What are your thoughts on such an initiative - does anyone reckon it will succeed here?",1572866844.0,"The single biggest minus point about Indian society is the non-existence of clear communication and lack of transparency and accountability in dealing with things.  

Such being the case, the 4 hour workday won't work because that kind of productivity requires an enormous amount of clarity with the undestanding that the everyone involved is working hard to get the job done.Japan and India are two entirely different animals.

Japan has an ageing workforce. It also has a work environment that emphasises employees working long hours. The stress had in recent times resulted in multiple news reports of employees committing suicide which had prompted a national outcry and condemnation.

In addition to this, the work-nolife balance also resulted in men and women choosing to marry late or choosing to delay having children. This isn't good considering the already low population growth rate in the country. This has even led to the mechanisation of many low end jobs in Japan because they can't find enough people to work.

So a 4 day work week might work in a country like Japan which is carrying out iniatives in order to promote population growth. The 4 day work week has a high synergy with these objectives.

India meanwhile has a high population growth, high unemployment and a young workforce. The competition here has prompted firms to cut costs in order to maintain profit. This often means a smaller workforce, which still does the same amount of work by taking longer hours; but without any commiserate increase in remuneration. 

Even when an employee is burned out, the rat race in India is so bad that there is always an enormous pool of often unemployed/underemployed applicants who are ready to be hired at short notice for a lower pay. So the employers can simply choose to fire the burned out employees and hire new recruits to keep the assembly line at work.

> You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

Increasingly, this is proving to be bad advice (even though it is WHO-supplied), and face masks are shown to reduce transmission. Doesn't have to be N95, even a cloth or handkerchief will help.

From [a study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/):

> S. Wearing masks outside the home in a reference period corresponding to the 2 weeks before symptom onset for cases was significantly protective against clinical SARS. Supporting the validity of this finding, there was a dose-response effect: by multivariable analysis, persons who always wore masks had a 70% lower risk of being diagnosed with clinical SARS compared with those who never wore masks, and persons with intermittent mask use had a 60% lower risk. Many persons who wore masks in the community did not use N-95 or similar highly efficient filtration devices, which have been recommended for use in the hospital setting.

If you break it up into 2 night trip it will be better idea. Pulikat lake is quite a sight esp if the birds are in town. Find a decent hotel within 1hr distance along the highway. Town everything will be booked up esp for this launch.

There is just one road leading to the site and security will stop you 5-6 km away, but you can take the mud road along the lake to the right of that security check point and find a good place to sit.

There are hundreds of people these days who watch from that road. It's not crowded or anything because its a very large lake bed and you can see the launch from any point along that road.

Also go post/read on r/isro you might find a lot more details from others  there.

30,I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends.,30,fahqeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fahqeu/i_am_from_shaheen_bagh_and_i_hope_the_protest/,15,"I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding.",1582861784.0,"Well if the protest ends here then its a amit shah victory he got a new template.... dangay karao protest khatam and you will see that applied all over india. If someone is protesting peacefully against injustice they have every rightI understand and empathize with your perspective. However, if you want the protest to end, that means you are okay with giving up the only resistance there exists against the CAA. Without the protests (and essentially no one being outraged), the Act gets implemented silently and obediently, and you are at the mercy of this genocidal government. You are okay with atrocities being committed against people of your religion and possibly you yourself. There is literally no other fight available to people right now other than peaceful protesting, even if it may eventually lead to nothing. At least it keeps international media attention on India and possibly reduces the damage inflicted on Muslims or postpones it. Unless you have a better alternative than protesting.

If you are okay with protesting, but not in Shaheen Bagh because it makes your life more difficult, and would rather that the protests moved elsewhere in a different locality, your argument is selfish, albeit valid, but undoubtedly selfish. And there's no merit in that for me, sorry. You would rather that someone else gets inconvenienced and threatened, and while of course that may be a natural reaction, it is not very endearing.No, OP. 

Do you think that if all protests end , the hatred will stop? 

No. 

Do you know what bjp's no. 1 weapon is? 

It is hate. Hate will always exist in people's hearts unless these hindutva goons sitting in the Centre are thrown. We need everyone in our country to realise that hateful hyper nationalism is very bad. Oppression is very bad.

Our route is (in that order): New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi, Kolkata and we want to use trains to move between them. On one hand it's safer and more robust to book everything online and not worry about the ticketing, but on the other we want to be flexible since nothing goes as planned.

What would you recommend? What's your experience?",1573068633.0,"Travelling in trains in India on non-reserved tickets is not something you would want to do. 

There's only about a month left so you better hurry and book your tickets on www.irctc.co.in otherwise you would not even get a reserved ticket.

To have a better idea about what type of tickets to book, search for 'What does 1A, 2A, 3A, SL, CC, 2S mean in Indian trains'. I would recommend you to book 3AC tickets.

Edit: You can book tickets 1 day before train's departure day under Tatkal quota too but it's risky and its costs extra money. Tickets can be sold out in under 5 minutes after it opens.You will get tickets easily even in Tatkal a day before while you are travelling Kanpur to Varanasi and Varanasi to Kolkata. 
I always used to take tickets a day before while I was living in Kolkata and coming to Varanasi my hometown. 

One of my friend used to stay in Kanpur and I often used to visit it in the same manner. .

If nothing is planned and you want a flexible journey, then you can do tickets a day before but be a little cautious and do it as soon as ticket booking opens, which is 10 a.m for A.c class and 11 a.m for sleeper class.  I would suggest you to book confirm ticket now, if it is available. You can cancel it later, if there is a change of plan and book a Tatkal ticket.

40,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,692,eogkmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/,345,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",1579006550.0,"People in the Northeast do not seem to have any dietary restrictions

However, the problem arises when bigots and racists use this to demonstrate their ‘non-Indianess’ for in their logic such people could only be ‘Chinese’If you want to see how Caste affects the perception of non-vegetarianism look no further than Tamil Nadu. The majority of the state is non-vegetarian. It has an incredibly developed Non-vegetarian cuisine. Ask anyone outside the south about the perception of Tamilians and its always vegetarian. Majority of the reason is because outside the state the vast majority of Tamilians working are Brahmins (especially in civil service), and most of the eateries outside the state are run by Brahmins.",Scheduled

As we all know, WhatsApp is a major source of disinformation in our country. To help mitigate this, I've created a bot that crowdsources information on fake WhatsApp forwards. It works with text, photos, videos, audio clips, etc.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

50,Can Indians grow a spine already?,273,f2y883,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2y883/can_indians_grow_a_spine_already/,164,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go.

56,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,338,7jhqsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jhqsa/tifu_by_being_from_a_scheduled_caste_but/,264,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites.

58,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",11,fkql7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fkql7h/askindia_fathersmothers_of_reddit_india_what_were/,5,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",1584571392.0,"OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well.https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural.1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies.

### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.

60,Appreciation to Maharashtra Government,17,fl8lmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl8lmk/appreciation_to_maharashtra_government/,23,"Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister. 

P.S.: These are just my own thoughts. You can choose to ignore them if you disagree",1584646611.0,"Let me explain why \*I think\* these are incorrect numbers:

Because you are comparing with the countries in west, let me tell you that those numbers are based on extensive testing on people. So if people show symptoms like cough, fever, cold, they get tested for this virus along with others. Which is why there are many positive cases in west.

Now in India, ask how many of people who have the above symptoms have got tested for this virus. Or even went to the Doctor? The less you test, the less the numbers you will get. The countries in west are already in under almost total lockdown, yet the numbers are increasing (due to the high R0 of the virus). While in India, we still have many major companies & businesses operating in full-capacity mode, big crowded markets in Mumbai still open like almost every day.  There is no point in shutting down the schools & keeping kids at home if their parents are going to work everyday in Mumbai locals & coming back home. There is absolutely no reason yet to believe that the virus hasn't really spread or the number of real infected persons are that low.

As a human first & Indian second, I really do hope that we do somehow have low numbers & we are doing a real good job. This could be one example where India could standout strong among other major countries once this is all over. But right now, it is too early to say that we are in a better position than other countries.Hi I'd like to say that I work in Healthcare in one of the biggest companies in India and even though the govt is trying to do a good job which is commendable, they've been lying about the numbers. We've known and we reported it at least two weeks ago before that info went public and also, they've messed with the numbers. It's way drastic than it seems but ofc I understand the logic behind it. They're trying to make the public not panic. Understandable",Scheduled

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once, Narayanan had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear. The President noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

***He then became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court and the Gauhati High Court before becoming the Supreme Court Judge.***

The Caravan Magazine says and I quote

>*the collegium had thrice considered and decided against Mishra’s nomination; on one of these occasions, it had asked for a background check on him.

Take proper rest. Sleep on time and eat well. It'll help tremendously. Your coaching time is when you should be the most attentive, if you're having headaches, you won't be able to focus properly.

>Did you learn anything?

If I was interested in the topic and my head felt in place, the classes were indeed fun and I learnt a lot. Some of the coaching teachers are very good. If it was a difficult or boring topic, my mind usually drifted away, and not paying attention in class only caused problems in future. Reading a little about the topic that's going to be taught beforehand helps.

If you actually understand what's being taught, it'll become MUCH easier to sit through those 7 hours, trust me. If you didn't get anything in the class today, read your notes, read the textbook, watch YouTube videos on the topic. Watch the video over and over till you finally understand what your coaching teacher was trying to say. There are many good YouTube channels for JEE syllabus, they helped me more than any notes or textbook. 

If you go to the next class without knowing what was taught in this class, it'll only get worse from there.

And bro, I've been in your place. It's very difficult, but you can't do anything about it expect make sure the hardwork you do gives you the result you want. Please make a proper schedule and stick to it. Always analyze how you do the in the exams, and take them seriously. Most importantly, please don't procrastinate. All the best!Education is important but it is so so overrated in our country.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.

### 3) International Judicial Conference 2020

The International Judicial Conference 2020 was held from 21st-23rd February 2020 in New Delhi.

* The Conference was organized by the Supreme Court of India.
* The theme of the Conference was ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’.
* Important Topics of discussion at the conference included :
   * Gender Justice,
   * Contemporary Perspectives on Protection of Constitutional Values,
   * Dynamic Interpretations of the Constitution in a Changing World,
   * Harmonization of Environment Protection vis-à-vis Sustainable Development and
   * Protection of Right to Privacy in the Internet Age.

#### Highlights from the Conference

* Sustainable Development: The Indian judiciary was appreciated for its balance between development and environment, and continued guidance in it.
   * E.g. Judgement on Sardar Sarovar Project
* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Rather, I am an American-born Pakistani. I have subscribed to this subreddit because I think it's important to understand the other half of the discussion. 

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception. I do still however maintain that it is an excellent step in the right direction as another commenter has mentioned.",1576897352.0,"Thank you mate <3.

This sub inspires me too, but any illusions about right wing fanaticism coming to an end in India are just that, pure delusion.

No amount of education is gonna change people like them and it's just sad to say that majority of the population in India is like them.> Brahman mandir me ganta bhajate hai aur hum logoko bewakoof banate hai

🙏

It's sad to see literates condoning casteism. How fucked up is our education system.Asking upper castes if discrimination exists is like asking white people if racism exists. Shocking as this may seem, most white people will say that ""racism used to exist 100 years ago maybe, but not anymore"".

Here's a simple idea. 90% of humans are right handed, 10% are left handed. If you look at all the students who have gotten into college and found that the split between right and left handers isn't 90-10, that's an indication that something strange is going on. If you see 95-5 or 99-1, that's not necessarily an indication that left handers are being discriminated against actively or that right handers are genetically superior, but certainly something to investigate further.

If you saw the 99-1 split in a saw mill, you might come to the conclusion that right handers are simply better, more hardworking, more deserving. After all, the interview process didn't ask them which their dominant hand was, and poor performers are fired. If you investigate, you'll realise that all your tools are designed for right handers (ask any left hander you know about scissors) and this inherent disadvantage means that they can't work effectively. But if you never investigate, you'll never find out. And even after, if you don't have the will to fix it, nothing will improve.

We need two things to solve a problem - figuring out the solution, then implementing the solution. If solving the problem would harm us, why would we bother? Why would a bunch of right handers fix the tools at the saw mill when it would increase competition for jobs?

---

And that is what reservation does. Upper castes (approx 30% of the population) would take 70-80% of the seats in higher education if there was no reservation. You might see that and think ""fair enough, if that's how the exam results look, that's the way it should be"". But we could potentially fix this by investing a *lot* more in public education, in rural education. If we paid teachers 3x more, spent 10x on teacher training, 5x more on school facilities, we would bridge the gap in 20 or 30 years. But we won't. Because the people with power and influence in society all send their kids to private schools anyway. We are not personally affected by the problem of a lack of opportunities, so we have no *incentive* to fix it, just like the right handers won't fix the tools.

If we actually fixed it and India became egalitarian, our 30% of society would only get around 30% of the seats. That's a *worse* situation than we are in currently (where we have 50%). Why would we spend thousands of crores to actually reduce the opportunities available for our kids? We won't. That's why reservation exists - to give an opportunity for the folks who went to shitty schools with shitty teachers a shot at a better life. 

---

And now you might reasonably ask - ""but look, what difference does it make? All the benefits go to a tiny minority of people from that caste."" And you are right. But you're forgetting two things. Firstly in India, people take care of their extended family. The first person from a clan to go to college and get a good job mentors their siblings and cousins, pays for their education, brings them up. 

And secondly, although most people from lower castes won't actually benefit from reservation, it's still a source of hope for them. They are poor, they have no prospects. Not only that, poor public education means their kids don't have prospects either. But they don't know it. They delude themselves into thinking their kids could potentially go to college under reservation. ""But this is horrible! These poor people are being duped!"" you might think. But it works out well for the rest of us, because the day the downtrodden majority wakes up and realises that they and their kids have no hope, they will burn society to the ground. The same will happen if reservation is stopped - because that is their only hope of a better life.

No more reservation sounds good. But all the colleges have been burned down. You'll have 100% of the seats - which are now 0. Enjoy.",Scheduled

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters.

86,(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here,34,f9a1i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9a1i5/confession_kinda_stuck_here/,17,"Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",1582665068.0,"Get another job and put your papers. Perks and privilege cannot compensate work-life balance.Hey, sorry to hear that you are in such situation. I can understand your dilemma. My only advice is that before you take any major steps like quitting, may be just give it a try to talk to your boss. 

From what you wrote it looks like he is a reasonable guy so may be  ask him for an unofficial coffee meeting and just calmly explains everything that you wrote here. But in a more businessy way (with concrete points, facts and numbers). For example: think from his perspective, he is the CEO of a start-up so the company's success hangs on his shoulder. You need to show him that you can do equally good or even better job in the 6 day week and contribute effectively in the company's growth. 

If its ok, you can also offer him a little reduction in your pay against one day off. Otherwise if he still disagrees try asking for alternatives, like home office or any other weekday off (where one of your colleagues can support if urgent).

No industry no matter which branch does not need to work round the clock. Even employees of emergency services like 911 work in shifts. So the expectation from company is unrealistic and by not hiring an additional resource they are just trying to save money. 

Nonetheless, if they really appreciate you and value your work they should agree to make little adjustments to keep you happy and productive. And if nothing else work then go ahead and quit. Your mental and physical health is much important and you will get another job sooner or later. All the best!Was in a similar position to yours last year , Didn't work 7 days like you but the work was intense like Going to office at 10AM and getting home at 11PM . Luckily I was an intern there So I was pretty sure I wouldn't want to join that company . I performed terribly in the last month and wasn't offered a job after the internship . Sure it took me like 2.5 month to find a new job and but it's worth it . 

Leave the current job . It isn't that bad as you think it is. Sure it will take you time to find a new job but this 7Days work is going to suck life out of you with little to no reward regarding the amount of effort you put in . People here have a bias for working in a startup but they often neglect this side of it .",Scheduled

These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers

88,(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma,8,fe9bye,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fe9bye/confession_in_a_dilemma/,11,"Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

Follow your instincts don't listen to other's opinions no matter how much XP they have.. cause end of the day either you will embrace your decisions or regret it but it will be all yours.

You boss is not your friend.
He /she is not looking out for you but the company. 
Your goals need to align to his goals. 

He/she is not responsible for you but you company.

HR is not your friend.

You don't speak the truth to your boss
 You speak what he wants to hear.

Be diplomatic.  You have issues with work hours. 
Say
 "" I love my job, but it's exhausting to work 7 days a week, I need a break to reboot. I feel I can be more productive to the company by working extra during the 6 days and getting that one day off.""It seems that your boss is to some extent happy with you, and you aren’t a burden.

Looks like you have a work ethic as well- perhaps fewer street smarts or experience than you’d like. 

Your boss may well be right, he may well be wrong. It helps to look at objective facts.

First, you can take a day off- something that is incredibly helpful in simply staying sane. 

Having 7 day work weeks, unless you are in a rare few professions, is hard to justify.

About being destroyed - awesome! This will happen regularly, and it’s worth it as eventually you start picking up on resilience. Part of which is learning to actually value things you value. It sucks, but usually it’s either an issue of confidence or of new information which doesn’t sit well with you.

Practically, you can just shut up, get paid and get on with life.

But this depends on what goals you want to achieve.

So perhaps you could Grind it out, work towards being independent and then in a position when you can study whatever you like in peace.

Quitting a job is sometimes draining; in your case, it seems the emotional manipulation is happening because you can’t parse what is being said and place it between manipulation or advice from a more experienced person.

You are also very tired so decision making is going to be colored by that.

Do you like your work? Are you doing good work? Are you learning? Are you building a portfolio?

Your boss seems to be giving pretty decent advice on average.  he can be wrong - and that’s something you have to prove him wrong about in the long run, you don’t have to do it today. Don’t pressure yourself unnecessarily.

You have lots of challenges you are dealing with it seems, so give yourself a pat on the back for improving your work life balance and move towards getting that totally handled.

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST.

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I’ve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I’m trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren’t that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I’m currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",1583796950.0,Upvoting for visibility.

Just learn this phraseFeel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one. It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended.

Our colony has always been a lot diverse in terms of religion. Everything was normal after the flag hoisting ceremony, members of the association gave speeches about our constitutional rights, fundamental rights and duties as well as secularism but it soon went downhill from that.

Another man from the colony started his speech about how our constitution and laws need amendments time after time and we should support them, and then he yelled that no matter what we believe we are must respect the national flag and national anthem and those who didn't do that or didn't return the cheer of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" are of no use to this colony or nation. An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

We may never know how many more bodies were thrown in the same nala where IB Officer Mr. Sharma body was found because they just washed away.,Politics

A young officer was on his round when one of the riflemen did not notice him and missed saluting him.
The youngster got cheesed off and summoned the Gorkha and asked him the reason for not saluting him. The Gorkha innocently gave out the reason that he did not see “Lieutenant Huzoor”.
The youngster not convinced, punished the Gorkha to a thousand salutes. The soldier immediately started saluting…
Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw who was passing by and asked the youngster as to what was happening. The youngster said, “Sir, this soldier had the audacity of not saluting me. So I have punished him with 1000 salutes.”

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",1580471131.0,"Something like Cuba and pretty much under a left dictatorship and would have moved in the same direction as PakistanIt's a counter factual - i.e., a logical fallacy.

177,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?",827,e1yy9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/,126,"After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",1574808704.0,"As someone who doesn't follow politics thank you for summarising everything that has happened.

Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them.

It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education.

213,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,9,dc6k28,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/,20,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading.",1570027532.0,"They will probably start unfollowing you or whatever it's called.

I want to find out a few things and I guess India could help me:
1. What are prospects of business?
2. How good is this as a career for not just survivability but to thrive? (I don't want to live in a mansion but yeah in long term a life where I don't have to worry)
3. What are different types of career options like I'm planning to do Product photography but what other than that, Wedding, etc.?
4. I'm about to complete my Bachelor's of Pharmacy (don't ask why Pharmacy, it just happened) but should I go for Masters Degree in Photography, I'm 22 years old.
5. What are good institution for photography courses and how to get an admission in them & other local classes where there are 6 months starter courses?
6. Where and how can I find work?",1572058302.0,"I have a cousin who occasionally comes to Bangalore to get her photography taken from brands and freelancers. She’s very into the modeling industry.

She’s had lots of pictures taken, but hasn’t paid even once. One time a photographer traveled for over an hour just so he could take free pictures and put it on his Instagram.
This person as far as I can tell has done this a lot of times to gain some followers.
He still hasn’t succeeded, he still has 800 the last time I checked.

Luckily since he’s been helping out my cousin she started paying him for his pictures. 
I think she paid him 3,000INR for 4 hours of shoot.

It’s hard being a photographer. I reckon that’s the first time he got paid.
Now he seems to be doing fine getting more connections. This took him over a year though.
So it’s hard work and requires lots of traveling.
I haven’t answered your question properly, but hope it helps. If you have any questions let me know I’ll ask and let you know.

As for money, learning to code pays off big time.  I did mechanical and am currently freelancing.
I started off with just HTML, CSS and JS. Which is like majority of the work most clients need.
Currently taking a break to learn a few more skills, and learning to code for these past years has paid off.

Photography is possible as well, but I reckon finding a job is way more hard especially since so many have a Instagram photography page and will do it for free.
I wish you all the best :)[deleted]",Photography

I slogged through most of my college days, somehow managing an meagre five pointer.

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",1561469849.0,"Slog through and get a proper job first side by side do photography.[Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o)I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first.

Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime.It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography.Everyone is a photographer these days.

243,Visiting India,10,es78p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es78p7/visiting_india/,9,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.",1579698430.0,"Hey, welcome to India. You don't have to worry about street photography in India because people will come to you for selfie for sure. 

You are coming at right time. The weather is good, you can enjoy the food. Go to food streets, Taj Mahal (drive in afternoon), gardens, historical sights, India gate and more. Feel free to msg if you need any more detailed info.Hi, Welcome to India! I hope you have a great trip here, apart from business.
As such, I do not think you would have issues doing street photography, people generally do not mind. If you think someone would mind, just let them know - and they will tell you if they don't want. I guess it would only be women being photographed that you need to worry about. Mostly, be careful of your gear in public to avoid something getting stolen.
Buildings can be photographed, as long as they are not government buildings, which may land you in a soup. Some historic places require separate tickets for professional photography, be sure to buy that. Also, if someone heckles you over rules, stand your ground. People do this for money, but don't mean to hurt.
Please be vigilant while you travel specially in public transport. 
In Delhi, Red Fort, Qutab Minar, Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jana Masjid, Akshardham are must visit. You can also do Agra for Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri. Jaipur is also a short distance from Delhi, with great forts to visit.Golden temple in Amritsar is also very good option. It maybe be best if you can take a local along. Tourist places can be mad crowded.
Visit old Delhi for street food delicacies. If this is your first visit, bring a strong stomach and the food will not disappoint you. I guarantee.
Let us know how it went. Enjoy!Welcome! 

It's completely okay to take pictures, and if you're not too shy, it's completely okay to dance like a maniac, roll on the streets, whatever. If you're comfortable around people different from you, people might even interact in funny ways, ask for pictures with you, stare, etc. etc.

It's going to be very crowded, possibly polluted. Very hot, unless it's within a month from now. 

Places are qutb minar, red fort, etc. etc. just try to be assertive so as to not get fleeced, and preferably go early morning to avoid the traffic, if it's not to hazy for your pictures.

You can't do anything disrespectful to them. only in temples, you have the be barefoot, sometimes cover your head, sometimes photography not allowed, but you will get to know about all that there itself. Beware of shoe stealers, pickpockets, all that jazz. Very common. And no need for the namaste's, they never happen.",Photography

Internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low fees.

I know because i tried myself in Bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear.... so it takes years to refund materials.

Doesn't make sense.

Second and last advice : be the best at postproduct (LR and PS)Take this question to [jjmpf](http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php) as well.Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

A hospitality group can afford a decent budget, but a small business type independent restaurant will be much more price conscious.

If you are new to food photography, my suggestion to you would be to be upfront and tell them you haven't done this professionally, which is why you will work with them on pricing, so its fair for both parties. Also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point, so that you don't get low balled.

You make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked, but until that day you do what you need to reach that level. Play the long game, money will come.

*Edit: Just saw you wrote zomato, swiggy. Quote high and wait for counter offer.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

305,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",14,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely.

But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",1548078786.0,"It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward.India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory.Your position is too simplistic. It’s the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‘freedom’ for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‘industriousness,’ the Chinese ‘stability and order’ and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself — and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don’t factor in how much of this ‘spirituality’ is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‘spiritualism’ is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It’s far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‘spirituality’ and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‘love and kindness’  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‘muslim countries’? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‘swarms’ as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: “Where is the love?”

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‘western’ countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here’s the thing: In my lifetime I’ve only seen it get better. 

I don’t even defend this characterization of India as a ‘spiritual’ place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It’s the foreign ‘Eat-Pray-Love’ crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that’s what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don’t think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that’s just wrong. ",AskIndia
312,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,55,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",1555627392.0,"You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close)I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place!I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol)",AskIndia

(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",1543864935.0,"In Hindu culture, the term gotra (Sanskrit: गोत्र) is commonly considered to be equivalent to clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or patriline. Generally the gotra forms an exogamous unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as incest.[1] The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes. Pāṇinidefines gotra for grammatical purposes as apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram (IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word gotra denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the Brihadaranyaka Upanisad2.2.6, Gautama and Bharadvāja, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Kaśhyapa and Shandilya are seven sages (also known as saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called gotrâvayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises pravaras.

e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen. ",AskIndia

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

317,We really need to talk about Flairs.,107,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not.Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad historyJust be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn’t . I don’t know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought......Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

I received this message. I want you to read and think about it. I am forwarding for that purpose""

Playing with people's insecurities. Not getting any women. Use this Axe deodorant and women will flock to you.

Did congress do nothing to give confidence to Indian people? When congress came to power it denotified the tribes which had so far been classified as criminal tribes. By recognizing their humanity, and by giving them an equal opportunity did it not give them confidence. What about the right to vote given to women and outcasts? Was it not ahistoric in the region. And the states which were created on linguistic basis. 

> MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

It was exactly opposite. Gandhism is a method to uphold the humanity and moral standards of the victims. 

> Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. 

When congress came to power, one of the first thing it did was to abolish zamindari system. Then it gave voice and entitlements to outcasts. 

> Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Dynamism of British period? Are sanghis missing their 'golden age' under white masters?

> people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered

People were not waiting for alms. People were poor and starving. Some folks have forgotten how poor India was and still it. Should congress have allowed them to die like China did? Is taking care of starving people and empowering them mutually exclusive? Can you not do both at the same time? Was it not something congress did?


> India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. 

NRI's guilt.

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",1437005483.0,"Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator.

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki. [deleted]>No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones.

334,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",9,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",1467222673.0,">Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage.I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again? > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision.",AskIndia

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

Yeah and not just the subreddit. For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote. Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low.

If you consider swiss uni. like ETHZ , they also ask for course material you referred so that you meet the academic standards/background they expect. I assume it's something similar in Germany.US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.

Getting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.

I'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB).

350,The long and fascinating story of how Dadra and Nagar Haveli got integrated into India.,17,25ix5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/25ix5m/the_long_and_fascinating_story_of_how_dadra_and/,2,"India is a big, complicated country with a big, complicated history. This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers? 

If you do relate to this phenomenon please don't shy away and open up about what you feel. Indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up. Some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big, it's only a matter of time. Bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions. How do we mitigate all of this?

India definitely have a fair share of recluse populace, but I doubt the people who stay in isolation for such long time can survive in India. Most of the parents of hikikomoris in Japan have come to accept the fact that their son/daughter is a shut in. I can't even imagine our parents being like that, especially when we as a country fail to stress the importance of mental health.Been working for a few months now but I spent around 5 years unemployed prior to it.

Lived with parents. Still do. They've been supportive.

College was the trigger for me I had zero liking for the course and at the same time didn't really have any interest at all which I could pursue instead. So I dragged myself through graduation because something was better than no qualification at all.

Initially I went through that phase where I punished myself for being a useless loser who fell behind his peers. But I never had any dreams or passions with regards to career and stuff so my NEET status in itself gradually stopped being too bothersome an issue to handle but every once in a while, when things went South, I wished I had a bearable facade of a purpose to keep myself occupied during those times. 

I've been always been pretty bad at socialising. Once I went into the NEET lifestyle and got completely acclimatised to it, it worsened the matter. I stopped keeping in touch with the few friends I had from school. I felt as if we inhabited different worlds so there wasn't much to converse about. Made a few friends online but the came and went.

I work now but it hasn't affected my feelings about work and social life.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.",1584571392.0,"OP, post this in r/TWOXINDIA as well.https://www.babycenter.com/childbirth-class has all you need to know about child birth. Regarding centers,city,hospital, I don’t know. India C section is becoming very much the de facto option which is sad malpractice by doctors. Most cases natural birth is possible without much medication. 3 of my kids were natural born without any medication. 4th one (actually our 2nd) she took epidural.1. Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.
2. 3 is average and is by no means overweight.   
3. Cervical examination is done to check how much the cervix has dilated. I was checked every hour when I went in while in labor (about 3-4 times). Ended up with a emergency c section as large baby + baby in distress.
4. Any bleeding in late term, even if it's due to cervical examination needs to be monitored. Unless the doctor did a membrane sweep, there shouldnt really be a bleeding but then again depends on sensitivity I guess.
5. I had a cervical check a day prior to my labor (I was at week 39 and very close to my due date) and I had no bleeding but went into labor naturally much later at night. I woke up with back pain after midnight and I just knew this was it. Went to the loo, water broke, told my husband it was time and then woke up my parents. Waddled to hospital 2 hours later after I timed my contractions and knew they were getting a min apart. 
6. High risk and multiples. Also Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women (I was induced despite being in labor already and the pain shot through the roof).
7. Only large hospitals can administer pain relief for vaginal birth as most hospitals in india don't have monitoring systems in place to check for contractions and tell the woman to push. 
8. None. I was birthing at my home town. So I chose the one which had a sensible doc that would listen to me and not swat my concerns as ""google"" led. Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala but I'm of the ""give birth in hospital"" opinion as I don't know how equipped these centers are to handle post natal and intensive care for babies.

The main challenges to getting this done is twofold:

1) Population. With such a large population, $12k per capita means 12k * 1.2 billion = $14 trillion economy in terms of income alone. By way of comparison, most economists think that getting to a $5 trillion economy will be a challenge given current economic conditions.

2) Skill. High income countries tend to have skilled manufacturing and services as a large proportion of their income earning population. India has technology* but it’s not as widespread as a proportion of the population.

Also having a high proportion of skilled industries and workers requires really good primary, secondary and tertiary education. India has historically under-invested in primary and secondary education and chosen to focus on highly selective tertiary education — the IITs and the IIMs, etc. This leads to great outcomes for the few who get into those but it doesn’t move the needle in terms of national income stats.

\* Many will argue that India does very little cutting edge work here, instead focusing on subcontracting for MNCs or replicating business models proven abroad. But I’m ignoring that for the purposes of this discussion.We are bound to be in the Middle-Income trap and there is nothing this or any other government can do?

Our women LFPR (labor force participation rate) is around 30% whereas we should be in high 60-70s at least. But the problem is while women LFPR increased due to families wanting additional income to get out of poverty, as soon as income of family increases, LFPR decreases - i.e. women participation in labor is temporary to supplant additional income on a temporary basis. This is a recipe for a middle-income trap.

Let's brainstorm on the solution

I can only think of two possible solutions:

&#x200B;

1. Limit government officials carrying cash per day to 2000, unless they can show legitimate proof, ACB can raid them and seize all unaccounted cash.
2. Nobody may pass above act, what we can do is take snapshot of all 500/-, 1000/- 2000/- notes while going out of home and if forced to bribe for no benefit, post snapshot of those notes and officer's name and location",1579371875.0,"I think the AAP gov. has a whatsapp number where people can send videos of officials demanding bribes. I think something along those lines can be done. If one suspects that an official might demand a bribe then record them knowingly/unknowingly. For instance, always record the police officer who comes at your place for passport verification. Make it known from the get-go that you're recording. I reckon he won't dare ask for a bribe then.Your Both solutions are appreciable but have certain flaws.
The first one is simply arbitrary, unreasonable and you can't go against a person who has been hiding all the money all this long. Plus the ACB raid part is the biggest flaw coz both the parties will collude and bribe and consolidate each other.

The second one is again a very tiresome and could be easily misused an official who is rightfully doing his duty. Moreover reporting is not enough. People still report. Some even do sting operation and provide whole videos as evidence but the officials with their incredible influence and power simply escape any retribution.

Now for the solution part - As much as I understand as a Son of an IPS Officer and having seen this class of people for almost my whole life, the sole reason insufficiency.
You can't expect the top Bureaucrats who collectively run and maintain the whole nation on a small salary of 1 Lakh or so or sometimes even lesser.
What I mean is that they surely need much much more for the kind of life they aspire to live after qualifying the toughest exams and service they give to the nation.

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

It's a huge loss to the public exchequer , most of the lent funds will never be recovered .It was a beautiful track. But an expensive sport like F1 isn't designed for India.

430,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,24,ftltyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/,5,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",1585860887.0,"> While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good.

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",1559652669.0,"The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records.

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",1579979425.0,"How much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve your goal? Is your goal worth those sacrifice? You have a lot of soul searching to do here. If you let your parents control the very aspect of your life that you have to live with all your life then you will resent the hell out of them when you have a failure in your academic life or eventual career, which, believe you me, everyone does. 

I'll give you two examples here, both are of my friends and you can take from it whatever you like. My friend named Ashish comes from a Marwari family and his father is a sales consultant. When he was 17, he was adamant that he wanted to do hospitality management like his cousin, who was pursuing it in London and not become a CA like his father wanted him to be. He eventually gave into his father's wishes and pursued being a CA. It took him 7 years to become a CA but he eventually became one and now has his own practice. He earns decent money now, married but resents his father to this day.

The second guy, Nikunj, brilliant in studies, just like you, and wanted to pursue commerce to become a banker but his parents insisted he do engineering since he scored to high a percentage in his boards to 'waste' it by doing a commerce course. He never completed his engineering and resented his parents for it. He eventually got into actuarial science and flourished; eventually his relationship with his parents improved too. 

Take what you may of these examples but imho you do what you love to do in life. Money will follow you no matter what. If you love what you do and are good at what you do the money will come to you no matter what.

P.S : Your parents expecting you to cook for your husband everyday is beyond shameful. I hope you don't feel obligated to be the typical subservient woman that is expected in an Indian household after your marriage, if you choose to marry. This patriarchal shit needs to end.[deleted][deleted]",Sports

We want cars that are cheap to own, cheap to run, cheap to repair and still seats 4-5 people at least. Whereas in western countries, the market dynamics are twisted. In the US, for instance, sedans are most common whereas in India it's little econobox hatchbacks. They measure fuel economy in gallons and we do so in litres. We want a lot of features but aren't able to pay the price. Things like this is why a lot of car makers have cars exclusively made for India, such as the Renault Kwid. Most of the cars you mentioned in the original post are from GM - DMC, Cadillac, Dodge etc. To be blunt, GM makes atrocious cars with abysmal quality. It takes a fortune to repair most of these and you will have to repair them. Another issue is that most of these vehicles are huge and expensive, and a very few people will buy them even if it is sold in India. GM tried to establish a market in India with Chevrolet, but again failed miserably. BMW and Benz sell most of their models in India, but they don't sell most of their sports car line up because 99% Indians can't or won't buy sports cars. So, it makes no sense to sell them in India.US cars are garbage. GM had to quit India after trying to dump China-made Chevrolet Sail.

FCA brands like Dodge have poor reputation even in the US for reliability issues.

Even Merc and BMW dump outdated models in India which are prone to breakdown in Indian conditions.No market here. infrastructure is so bad that models of 90s or 80s of these high end cars remain no longer reliable",Sports

482,COVID-19 - Information,1,fm9kmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fm9kmq/covid19_information/,1,"&#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

# Actions taken by Gov of India

Now this is crucial part. India is a federal state and cannot impose restrictions directly as it is a state matter, until or unless Emergency is invoked.

Timeline of measures and recommendations to states:

**20th of March**

* Recommendation for implementation of social distancing measures
   * 50 per cent of Group B and C employees are required to attend office every day, and the remaining 50 per cent staff should be instructed to work from home.
   * Weekly roster of duty should be drafted for Group B and C staff and they are to attend office on alternate weeks.
   * Working hours for all employees who attend office on a particular day should be staggered.
   * Further, States shall issue instructions for regulating hours in all services except for essential services. Industrial establishments to consider staggered timings and regulation of crowd in market should also be resorted to.
   * States shall issue directions to private sector to consider work from home wherever feasible.
   * All educational institutions, theatres, museums, gyms, exam centers, etc., shall be closed temporarily.
   * States shall take necessary actions to ensure that all sporting events, competitions and religious gatherings shall be postponed and it shall be ensured that required social distanced is maintained even in smaller gatherings.
   * With respect to public transport, it is directed that metros, railways, buses and airplanes shall consider decrease in frequency of their services, **alternate seating to ensure social distancing**.  Effective disinfection and crowd management be ensured in places like railway stations, metro stations, bus stands, and airports.
   * Railways have already issued orders in deference to GoM directions wherein travel concessions for senior citizens and all others availing concessional booking except for patients, students and divyangjan category since 0000 hours of 20 March 2020 have been temporarily suspended.
   * Further, in order to protect the most vulnerable of our population, all states shall issue appropriate instructions where in all citizens above 65 years except for public representatives/government servants/medical professionals should be advised to remain at home and avoid gatherings except for medical reasons and need for essential services.
   * **Youth and citizens are urged to become volunteers to support the government’s ongoing efforts in management of COVID-19.**
   * Ministry of Pharma and Consumer Affairs to take necessary action against anyone charging exorbitant price for masks, sanitizers, and other health related logistic material and to facilitate their availability in all hospitals and to people at large. They also directed that people should be sensitized on appropriate use of masks, to be utilized only when needed and to wash hands with soap.

&#x200B;

**8th of March \[**[**https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/COVIDCabSecLetterGuidelines.pdf)**\]**

Some of the steps proposed:

&#x200B;

* Identification  of  facilities/buildings  that  can  be  used  as  quarantine  centres or  can  be converted to temporary hospitals with isolation facilities;
* Ensure sanitation of seats, handles & bars of all public transport vehicles;
* Display of public health messages on public transport vehicles
* Facilitate mobilization of Self-Help Groups(SHGs) to create awareness

IMO, if this cannot be backed up with numbers and is just your or somebody's qualitative interpretation, it's better to remove it.

Since I've a brownish skin color, most of the sunscreens I tried left a white cast on my face.

Currently using Neutrogena Ultrasheer dry touch SPF 50 + sun block. Unless I use half or less than half of actually recommended amount on face, it doesn't show white cast. But, this way I'm not completely protecting my skin.

Do you have any suggestions far sun screen that doesn't leave white cast and doesn't make your skin look greasy.",1577461588.0,"I haven't used any Sunscreens though,but my moisturiser has bit of spf protection.Anyways, What i have learnt is that anything spf20 is usually enough.  The white cast is due to the ingredients present in the sunscreen. You need to apply the sunscreen every 2 hours or so ,for complete protection- which is a big chore in my book.Amazon has the plum sunscreen some of the comments suggest no white cast after using it, for me iam using tvaksh sunscreenaaaa.... we need sunscreena?

isn't that for white person?

try nivea cream that comes inside a flat blue color metal dabbi. I seen my mom put that before going outside on her hands. Don't know if that is sunscreen or have the  spf and all 🤷🏾‍♂️

But if you want to absolutely protect from sun, use that white thing sports guys use, i think it will be more than strong enough for casual outing if it can be used in sports matches in afternoon summer heat.",Sports

Don't get me wrong I'm a die-hard cricket fan and love the sport, but even I can see that our team is not as great as its propped up to be by cricinfo and other cricketing sites (our away record is atrocious and we often get to play at home against teams like WI, Bang or SL). But that's the problem, we ignore all the faults and concentrate on small successes, if we want to develop we must admit that there are issues with our nation, I'm using cricket as a small but valid example in a list of much larger problems we are facing .

Further when I talk to my cousins who are NRIs and have probably lived like 2 years in India after birth, they always talk as if our nation is some 1st world kingdom and all those criticizing it are anti-Indian propagandists, we Indians (especially NRIs) need to understand that we still are facing a lot of problems and there is still a long road ahead before we are actually a superpower.",1578447601.0,"Cricket is there to act as an opium for the indian masses and not to achieve actual feats in the game, that is secondary. hahaWhat are you smoking dude?

* The worrisome man­animal conflict in the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) on account of water seems to be a thing of the past. There was no incident of wild animals straying into human habitations for water last year and it would hold good for the current season too as there is enough water for them to tide over the harsh summer in the Reserve, which is spread over 893 sq km of core area and 1,122 sq km of a buffer. 
* The Reserve covers areas in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, and Nirmal districts in Telangana

* The GoM meeting was convened to create greater synergy between ministries on the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2018

 

### 3) Kiliki language

The new speech was invented for the terrifying warrior tribe called Kalakeya in the two-part Baahubali franchise.  It now has evolved into a language with script grammar and more than 3000 words for everyday communication. It is considered as the world’s easiest language. This fictional language was created by popular lyricist and screenwriter Madhan Karky.

### 6) What is the happiness curriculum?

On her upcoming visit to India next week along with US President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump will visit a Delhi government school, where she will attend a happiness curriculum class.

#### What is it?

The curriculum is one of the flagship schemes of the Delhi government in the education sector launched in July 2018 in all MCD schools.

* The curriculum calls for schools in India to promote development in cognition, language, literacy, numeracy and the arts along with addressing the wellbeing and happiness of students.
* It further says that future citizens need to be “mindful, aware, awakened, empathetic, firmly rooted in their identity…” based on the premise that education has a larger purpose, which cannot be in isolation from the “dire needs” of today’s society.

 

### 7) The Sunderbans and Climate Change

* The monsoon in Sunderbans is likely to last longer and get more intense, according to a fact sheet titled The Sunderbans and Climate Change, which was made public during the ongoing Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.
* Climate specialists have predicted that as climate change progresses, monsoon seasons in the Sundarbans will become longer and more intense. Conversely, drought conditions will also become more pronounced, presenting further challenges for agricultural producers in particular and ecosystems in general,” said the document released during the Conference of Parties being held at Gujarat.",1582479837.0,"That is contradictory.

494,"I wanna follow football,where do i start?",12,ets1uv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ets1uv/i_wanna_follow_footballwhere_do_i_start/,4,"I dont follow any sport which makes me hard to blend in at social events, i want to follow football, any suggestions will be appreciated.",1579994765.0,"You want to follow football just to blend in at social events?


Anyway, I'd suggest you to stwrt watching EPL (English Premier League) matches (Weekends mostly, on Hotstar or Star sports). It's the most followed league. So, you can google the fixture timungs of top 4-5 teams in the league. 


You'll learn about the rules slowly by yourself as you gather more interest in the sport. Also, follow r/soccer for updates on International football. 


We've got ISL on national level too. You can follow r/Indianfootball for updates on that.Just start watching games and play as often as you can. There's nothing like the thrill of being involved in a nice passing move like the one you saw in the match on the weekend.  
  
Good/exciting teams to watch in the English Premier League (EPL) at the moment: Liverpool, Man City, Leicester City.  
  
I myself am an Arsenal fan and I invite you to join me in supporting the club if you're masochist who doesn't have enough pain and disappointment in your life.  
  
As for other leagues, I don't know much. Perhaps others can help you. As far as I can tell, pretty much all EPL games are broadcast in India. Most La Liga (Spain) and Bundesliga (Germany) games are broadcast. Serie A (Italy) and Ligue Un (France) are harder to follow.  
  
I suggest you don't pick a team to watch at first. Just watch whatever football you can. But my honest suggestion is to not feel pressured into supporting ""local"". Your time is precious. Football, playing or watching, is supposed to be recreational and enjoyable. Watching 22 guys kick and rush and plod around a grass rectangle can be difficult to really get into. But if you watch high quality football, there's nothing like it.  
  
The channel Tifo Football on YouTube has some really nice videos on history, tactics, and current news in football. Maybe others can mention more YT channels that put out good content. 
  
If you're a reader, I can't recommend anything more highly than the book Inverting the Pyramid by Jonathan Wilson. It's a beautiful book that will introduce you to the history of the game, the quaint developments along the way, and some of the most fascinating and inspiring characters in the sport. I was already bitten by the bug before I read the book but reading it only intensified my love for the game and put me into a phase of obsessing over it.  
  
**Most importantly, I suggest you should not feel obliged to follow football because everyone around you is talking about it. I don't want to assume too much but the way your post is worded makes me think everyone around you mainly talks about football and you have nothing to contribute. If that's what they're doing then don't be hesitant about breaking it up and talking about something else which is of common interest. I've been that asshole who used to talk only football and had nothing to say about anything else. It's shit and I would have been grateful for friends who were willing to talk about other stuff.**  
  
If football doesn't catch your fancy, you don't need to watch it. It's a wonderful sport and I hope my suggestions are of help in getting you to love it the way I do but really, it's not the be all and end all. Most football bros eventually grow out of talking about it 24/7. Do what you like. Cultivate your own interests and introduce others to them like I'm trying to introduce to football. I'm sure they'll be grateful.[deleted]",Sports

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

553,[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,35,6izxwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6izxwj/nonpoliticalserious_whats_your_thoughts_on_gst_now/,10,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
",1498235539.0,"I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

 To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do",Non-Political

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

603,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,8,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",1532391253.0,"why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job?I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. ",Science/Technology

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is

>

> — Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",1558060692.0,,Science/Technology
615,Need help with depression and anger.,5,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",1519186110.0,"Go through these things maybe it can help you. 

1. Get off social media, right now. Social media has been linked the number 1 place where one can get depressed easily, by looking at where your friends are and their success and looking at where you are. Want a hang of social media, Do redditing. Here people don't know you. Go to the subreddits that interests you. Talk your heart out.   

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life. 

5. You have to survive no matter what life gives you.   


**Think of yourselves as company whose shares prices have tanked down to their all time low. Take decisions that will take the company high. Don't lose hope.**

**You Go out there and Kill it**

All the Best :) Man! This brings back memories.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.


Did you watch Black Panther? It's super cool.

616,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",46,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

",1435198646.0,"Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year?I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",1403105851.0,"Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.",Science/Technology

There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist.

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed.

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.",1581266387.0,"You seriously need counseling. These thoughts are no jokes. 

What really blows my mind is how our lives are similar yet different. 

I didn't get any decent job for about 2 years after I finished my B.Tech. When I got one after a year or so my company decided to close the unit and everyone lost their jobs. 

Then I started to teach few students and decided to try for government job. Even cleared all the exams but failed to get into final selection list. 

Then I joined another company and there I got into an accident. 

I severely damaged my arm and doctors told me to avoid heavy work for at least 2 years later. I took few steps back and started to teach in a college as a part time assistant lecturer. 

Even after all the bad luck I never felt hopeless. 

I am still in search for a decent job but I always try to be optimistic. 

I recommend you to get professional help before hurting yourself.You sir, are not a failure. You have managed to persevere till this day even with the constant downs in your life. Better things await you in your life from here on.

Wishing all the very best to ISRO!For people asking why ISRO is doing this:

We need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon's gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.

To set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. 

For ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.

Edit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:

Because we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.

If you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter's Moon)

If something were to happen to earth it's impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race.Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren't doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It's simple as that.

If isro wasn't doing its thing all this while, we would've been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.

So if you are questioning why it's important to explore moon and other places, it's not for you. Maybe it's for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.

Do we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn't created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations.",Science/Technology

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

652,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,496,d0ffgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0ffgv/chandrayaan_moon_landing/,1435,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",1575564775.0,"The priorities of the people and (so) of the government are wrong.

[Science & Technology],7,5jscfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,3,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

660,Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,81,ei5wg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei5wg9/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/,17,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

I recently got placed in two MNC's first is 'hexaware technologies' and second is 'infosys'.
I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey?

And it's not even a very good career choice,96,cwfx3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cwfx3i/why_is_engineering_so_promoted_across_india_and/,114,"It's a rant-cum-question, that why is engineering so much promoted across India, that too Software Engineering? It's not like a very good career choice

I'm a fresher and got placed from my college and working for around 2 months now, but wtf is people's obsession is with this field? It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate, 9 hours in front of computer, and 3 hours in traffic for 5 days a week and wait for weekends to complete your sleep.
Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit 
I just don't get it, the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children? And how can they be proud of this? Like what are you proud of, that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?",1566995645.0,"It might not be what interests you but all things included, it is a better job than nearly everything else out there right after graduation. In most jobs (engineering or otherwise), you have to sit in front of the computer for 9 hours and you cannot take a vacation when you want and you don't even come close to earning what a software engineer earns. It is also the one field where you can get jobs right out of college. You can say about doctors but not everyone has the memorization capacity, dedication and the amount of time and money required to be one.

The only other alternatives are having a business or working as a freelancer on a contract basis. In the first, you are your own boss and can take vacations but end up worrying about the business 24/7. Also, you need substantial capital to start one and most startups fail. The second option of freelancer is a very unstable one.

Indian parents are most concerned about job stability and finding a suitable wedding match, in both of which Software engineering takes a prime spot (unless you have an MBA of course)Hey one doubt... I became project manager but did not get the 50-60lpa.. kahan complaint karoon?",Science/Technology

Raised by Mom who worked at a private school.  

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.  

They just want to see you happy, it's just that their scale of happiness is a bit off.  Trust them to trust you.",1563461821.0,Thanks for sharing - somewhere there is a person that is at a cross road - who will read this and  your lessons maybe the push they need.

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

At this stage, I am just wishing that these Sanghis just go away. I don't want another social evil devouring this country.

BJP:

>Reservation for Women - BJP is committed to 33% reservation in parliament and state assemblies through a constitutional amendment.


They seem unanimous, yet the bill won't pass. Or will it?I'm a first time voter and honestly this is a lot to take in. I can't decide whom to vote for.

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.",1574968777.0,"Do invest your time in courses outside campus.
They surely boost your chances for better packageYou cannot do just one. You need to know both technologies and have problem solving ability. PSA builds by more practice, whereas knowledge of a framework comes with a little less. 

You have to choose b/w full stack dev, data analyst, and other options. Stick to one path,  learn the tech (take a month or less and learn it through a project that you can upload on GitHub), and then start practicing from hackerearth, etc. Don't try to become the best programmer, instead try to crack the interview. Go through geeksforgeeks and in maybe 2 months have an understanding of the algos and types of questions asked. Then start applying.",Science/Technology

So, I've decided to give myself a 2 month deadline to decide what other career to choose. And withing one month of deciding, I'll quit my job and embark on that new career. But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

6) Ready to pursue any course in any other field (Banking etc)

The most important thing is networking with the people working or planning to work in this field. The easiest way to do that is to get a degree in this field. So, look into Asian College of Journalism, Symbiosis, Tata Institute of Social Sciences and JNU. Also, familiarise yourself with the top names in this field, both organisations and individuals. So, for example, if you want to work on the environment there is Centre for Science and Environment and Sunita Narain. If you want to do something in politics, there's Yogendra Yadav and Swaraj Abhiyan. If you want to work on rural issues there's P Sainath and People's Archive of Rural India.

While dates are just markers of time, they also have a psychological effect, the transition in to something new. On the eve of a new decade, this is my message to my fellow friends.

Friends,

Almost all of us have lived through the past decade. Some of you have even seen another momentous shift, ushering in the new millennium; while others have seen more of these events passing by.

The last ten years have redefined the way we live, and we are now even closer to each other. Things that were science fiction to a kid in the 1990s is a reality. Yet, we are using technology not to express ourselves but divide who we are collectively as humans. Algorithms are segmenting and compartmentalizing us on the basis of not only our ethnicity, but also our choices, our preferences and our actions. We are using all of the benefits of our interconnected ways in the worst ways possible; using it to gang up, humiliate and shame those that don't agree to our thoughts. We are still waging wars, and selling ourselves to be slaves for things that are pointless in the grand scheme of things.

However, today; you can stop that. You, yes you. You have the power to change, to redefine, to come together and fight all of the differences whose seeds are sown across our collective psyche. It is you who has the power to change your own life, and the power to change the lives of others around you. You may think you are an insignificant part amongst billions of people, but you're not. Today is the day you have the capability to lead by example, to create a harmonious future for the generation that comes after us, and most importantly, for yourself.

It is normal to fear, because I am afraid, more of myself and of failing others, but I am more afraid of failing to provide a better life for the next generation. But, it has to have a start somewhere, so why not today? I don't ask you of anything, but to do what your conscience thinks is right.

Thank you for reading.

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first?

In older days people were shy to ask more food being guests. This was understood by the host. The hosts, hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy. 

These days people are generally very forthcoming (especially in American culture I observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want). But sometimes, being hosts, they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied. Just insist that you are full politely and say, you have reached your capacity. They will usually understand.

Another thing to do is, hold your palm facing the ground over the plate, to block the food and just insist more telling you are full. This gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings.

> New Delhi:

> From videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting Muslims are immune to coronavirus, the Delhi Police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the government's efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic.

> In an investigation of the content being shared on WhatsApp and apps like TikTok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown, the Delhi Police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the Muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders.

> An analysis of more than 30,000 videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in Hindi and Urdu for a specific audience, the police said.

> The videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers, fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by NDTV. According to early estimates, more than 1 crore people have already seen these videos, suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact.

> ""Several of these videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in India,"" the 22-page report, which the Delhi Police has shared with various intelligence agencies, says.

> ""Our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising Muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill Muslims,"" a senior police official said.

> According to him, the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation.

> ""While analysing the origins and sources of these videos, it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin,"" he said.

> ""Considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software, being viralled (sic) on social media platforms, original uploader accounts being deleted, and certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,"" the report says.

> According to the investigation, Chinese-owned video sharing app TikTok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

My boyfriend is from India and I am American.
He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",1585485942.0,"""Aaj mera upwas hain""

Just learn this phraseFeel free to refuse. A lot of Indians don’t understand boundaries and therefore it’s upto you to have one. It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I understand what you're trying to express, I used to be in a similar state by being an overeater/emotional overeater. Especially when my mom or aunts would pour in more food in my plate than required. You could do a couple things depending on how close you are with them.

1. You could express yourself, and open yourself to them, so they wouldn't push you any further 
2. Pretend to be ""full"" before you actually are, so when they do stuff your plate with more foods, you don't feel sick. 
Or. 
3. As soon as you're done, you run to the kitchen to leave your plate. (Wouldn't really just that, but the idea was somewhat funny.)

Hope it helps! Besides, if they care for you, (as we try to show our affection by feeding others), they'd understand what you're going through and wouldn't be offended.

* Take a white fish and fillet it.
* Brush the side with beaten eggs
* Sprinkle peanut chutney on it. Press lightly to ensure it sticks on the fish. (Refer peanut chutney details at end of comment)
* flip over and apply eggwash and then chutney sprinkle on it
* Fry 2 mins per side on a pan which is on medium heat

Recipe for rice:

* Cook rice as you normally do (I used a rice cooker).
* After rice is done, mix in chopped fresh herbs ( I used oregano and basil)

Recipe for coconut milk gravy:

* In a sauce pan saute chopped onions till they turn translucent. Use oil with a high smoking point or ghee.
* Add in chopped tomatoes and mix
* add spices (salt as per taste, red chilli powder 1/2 tbsp, turmeric powder 1 tsp, garam masala 1/2tbsp, coriander powder 1/2 tbsp, and asafoetida 1 tsp.)
* mix spices and wait for oil to be released.
* add 1 can of coconut milk and mix.
* bring to boil on high heat. reduce heat and let simmer for 3-5 mins.

Plating:

* Use the rice to create a bed/foundation layer
* place fried fish
* use a ladle or spoon to pour gravy on the sides of the rice (like a moat)
* garnish with micro greens or chopped herbs.

Peanut Chutney:

Typically you can purchase dry peanut chutney in indian stores. I have used what is known as 'Shengdana chi chutney' (chutney of groudnuts) commonly used in maharashtra with vada pav. You can make it at as follows at home:

* Take peanuts/ground nuts and dry roast them on medium heat till they turn brown
* peel off any remaining skin
* pound the peanuts in a mortar and pestle along with diced garlic, red chilli powder, cumin seeds, and salt. I use 1/3rd cup of garlic cloves, 1 tbsp red chilli powder, 1 tsp cumin seeds, and 2 sprinkles of salt for 1 cup of peanuts.
* You can use a food processor as well, but it will make it a fine powder. mortar and pestle will need some elbow grease but will give a more granular texture.That looks fantastic! It's got me in the mood for a second lunch",Food

But an average Indian currently in Australia is much worse off than an aussie. 

While many less wealthy countries are doing the right thing, Australia is doing its best not to look after the temporary residents saying that they are only visa holders. So government has no responsibility. 

In contrast to this, all foreigners in Portugal with pending applications will be treated as permanent residents from Monday until at least July 1, this ensures migrants have access to public services during the corona virus outbreak. 

Applicants including asylum seekers need only provide evidence of an ongoing request to qualify, granting them access to the national health service, welfare benefits, etc. Temporary residents in Australia are not even covered by national health insurance scheme and beleive me many don't have health insurance. 


Our own temporary visa holders in Australia won't be getting any benefit from their government. While Aussie citizens and PR holders will be entitled to receive benefits, many people on visas even those who pay the same amount of tax and are as disadvantaged by the situation, will now be asked to fend for themselves.

Meanwhile when it affects their own citizens all the rules go out of the window, for example recently Australian government allowed all international students to work unlimited hours as opposed to normally allowed 20 hours a week, as long as they are working in supermarkets stocking shelves for Aussies.

I am hearing news from smaller towns and cities for example Adelaide, where some Indian groceries are helping students giving free rations as many have lost their casual jobs.

On top of that, many people who came to India on bridging visas which has condition to return back within 3 months, Australian government has placed travel restrictions for 6 months, yes it only applied to temporary visas. Doesn't matter if you are living there from last 5-10 years. 

Now these people are stuck in India and many have lost their dream of getting residency, what's worse is they can't even go back to settle their affairs and sell their belongings, say their goodbyes. The government refuses to extend the deadline on their entry due to no fault of their own because they are visa holders and not Australians.

1. Consider this as a curfew - Modi
2. This will be a 3-week lockdown...
3. As per experts -If we are not able to control it in 3 weeks, we will have to pay a huge price for this.
4. 1 infected guy can infect hundreds in less than a week as per the experts and initially, you won't be able to detect any symptoms.
5. Italy and America have world-class facilities still they were not able to stop it from spreading.
6. From their experience we can learn that there is only one way to cope with this Virus, We have to stay at home ""no matter what happens"", Practice Social Distancing.
7. Don't cross that Laxman-Rekha, break the chain.
8. Our current actions will decide the fate of our country.
9. ""Jaan hai toh Jahan hai""
10. If we won't behave in these 21 days of lockdown, it could result into a setback of 21 years.
11. Pray and appreciate the efforts of those Ambulance drivers, nurses, doctors who are working for us and sanitizing our localities.
12. Appreciate the efforts of the security forces who are away from their families and they have to deal with our rude behavior sometimes.
13. WHO, Medical experts are guiding us and the Central Government is taking appropriate steps to cope with this issue.
14. INR 15,000 Crore allocated to improve our medical infrastructure.
15. Medical and Paramedical training will be provided.
16. Healthcare will be the first priority of every state from now on.
17. Please don't pay attention to fake news.

Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",1585260863.0,">drinking warm water or hot water

>milk with turmeric

turmeric has anti microbial property .

Gargling works on a simple phenomenon i.e plasmolysis but do remember to add salt..otherwise gargling is useless.

1. In Karnataka, tonnes of grapes have found their way to compost pits amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees.
2. Next week the harvest season will begin for India’s most staple wheat crop. In all probability, shortage of hands for harvesting wheat could lead to rotting of the crop in the fields. 
3. In France, acute shortage of seasonal labour to harvest crops has prompted the government call unemployed to help farmers.
4. In the US, the virus has sent farm workers, half of whom are undocumented migrant labourers, uncovered by $2 trillion stimulus, into panic

The government has so far given a welfare relief of only Rs 1.7 lakh crore, which is just about 1.2% of GDP and that too largely for formal sector workers. The informal sector, which constitutes about 80% of the country’s workforce,  is yet to get any relief

770,Theory : gujrati food has so many dry snacks because of their long distance travelling since ancient times,51,f5aarr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f5aarr/theory_gujrati_food_has_so_many_dry_snacks/,19,"Gujaratis have been involved in trade, buisness etc since a long time. From the indus Valley time's  lothal port to trading with Africa, gujratis often travelled long distances during their travels.

In order to survive these journeys, they made large variety of dry snacks which won't spoil easily. This is the reason why gujrati diet has so many dry snacks as its part",1581982096.0,"But, by that logic shouldn't odias also have dry snacks too..we were a seafaring people too with trade relations in the far East.Now this is just my theory, so take it with a pinch of salt. It's based on my mother and my grandmother's account of her childhood.

Basically, Gujarat is semi arid region and water deficient in most parts. Pulses generally grow in such areas where irrigation is lacking and rain is scarce. Back in the days, most people consumed what grows in the region. Groundnut was another crop. So you see the diet dominant in these pulses and groundnut. Oil used is also the same while much of North India used sarson.. (which is non existent in Gujarat, btw). White rice seems a recent entrant on the plate. Earlier it used to be mostly red rice. (My mom says that they had to queue up with the ration shop when they come to know that white rice has arrived.) Most elders in my family used to eat jowar till 90s (in South Gujarat). In Saurashtra, it would be bajra. Again, wheat rotis become popular only recently. (May be post 70s). 

My grandmother said that back in the days, they would get vegetables only during monsoon and winter. For most of the summer, they would only eat mangoes (which was in abundance in the season.) Sabji was just some pulses cooked into a curry like -dried chana, moong, besan etc. No green veggies for summer. So you see most of the gujju dishes have a base of pulses, because essentially that's what was available. 

Actually besan is a common ingredient across rajasthan, gujarat and Maharashtra - all historically water deficient states. The super fried snacks may be a recent addition. (I remember there were only 2-3 famous shops in my hometown in the 90s and most of the snack was bought and consumed garama-garam.. after 10 in the morning and 7 in the evening, you won't get anything...it's consumption may have increased with it being available in packets everywhere now.)  Also, they are not limited to Gujarat only. Even South has its variant of ""murukku"". The Gujarati or rather Central Indian snacks became more famous recently because of Haldiram maybe? Even the ""murmura"" snacks are common in much of India. 

But yes, we do like to carry our food along while traveling. Though that has to do with our ""save money for 1 meal"" tendency plus ""won't find vegetarian food"" problem. Don't think it has much to do with the seafarers. They probably had an abundance of macchi from the Arabian sea on their way to Africa.This is the state of affairs. The OP posted a theory based on Geopolitics about Food and in no way claimed any superiority but barring few all comments are bashing the OP or Gujaratis. 

About the theory, quite plausible. It is often the case that even today Gujaratis travel with their own food in trains etc. This is an indicative of a culture which carries food with them, and the day snacks such as Farsan (not just Gujarati) are quite nutritious and energy rich for journeys. 
But that's just my perspective, I am sure you will find some research about it.

773,A long read but definitely provides much food for thought! Would like to know your thoughts on this.,0,fsagi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsagi8/a_long_read_but_definitely_provides_much_food_for/,7,"A comprehensive summary and analysis by Jaideep Varma. 

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",1585678744.0,"One point missed here is the problem of sudden surge in cases, overwhelming the medical system. Common flu happens at a level much below the usual medical system capability. When number of people needing medical attention and ventilator increase above the medical capacity, then the medical system ceases to exist for new patients. The real problem with Coronavirus isn't its spread or lethality, it is its spread relative to what the healthcare system can handle. 

UK gave similar argument as the above post in the beginning, with herd immunity and downplayed the risks giving similar arguments. But the Imperial College study showed that if unchecked, mortality would be very high. The guy who wrote this post is about 3 weeks late to the discussion which has evolved rapidly. 

Moreover, the number quoted above are only preliminary. Coronavirus isn't over yet.I didn't read the whole thing through, so pardon me if I misunderstood it but there are some ground realities that's being ignored.

First, flu doesn't affect the whole population in a short period of time. Its infection is spread out in a longer period of time so that it doesn't overwhelmed healthcare facilities. So those infected can get proper treatment. It's also less lethal and less contagious.

Second, anybody could fall sick or get into a situation that requires medical help but wouldn't be able to because hospitals are filled with Covid-19 patients. And this would increase deaths from other causes. Pregnant mothers too aren't able to get medical assistance as a result.

Third, we don't yet know the long term implications of Covid-19. Death isn't the only thing that we should be concern about a disease. Will any tissues or organs be impaired permanently? Do those who recovered become fully fit and healthy?",Food

10 crore people are homeless worldwide, and crores of people are homeless or underprivileged in India alone

And with this lockdown, their daily income might be restricted or cut off completely.  
Their access to food and ability to buy food might be restricted or cut off completely.  


**It takes 2 days without food for the effects of starvation to kick in**

I am not sure if this post violates any guidelines or if there's a seperate thread going on regarding this..
But here is the thing; I am very sure you must have stumbled upon some news of how the poor and daily wage earners are hardly hit because of this lockdown. I think it's our responsibility to take care of these people during this hard phase that they are going through.
Here are some links to NGOs working to feed these hard hit poor during the lockdown. I am not sure if the help is actually reaching upto them or not but I guess it's not the right time to sit back and judge. If possible please donate to these campaigns-

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

&#x200B;

I hope you don't mind me posting this here for some advice! I'm a teacher from Sydney, Australia and I've just started my own online business. I want to start building a customer base in India first because I have worked with a lot of Indian children here in Australia and I always have a very positive relationship with them and their families. I also feel that our countries have a good friendship!

&#x200B;

Anyway, my product is digital and subscription based and I'm trying to work out the best way to promote it to parents and schools in India. I'll keep it as vague as possible so it doesn't come across like a promotion here, but I haven't been able to find reliable answers to some questions in my research:  


1. Is 400 Rs per month a reasonable price for an online subscription? I want to make it affordable for as many families as possible.
2. What are the most effective forms of advertising to reach parents? I'm on a limited budget and putting a lot of my time into my products, so I want to make sure I'm choosing the right advertising channels.

Thank you all so much for reading my post and any insight you can offer :)",1578598858.0,"It really depends on who your target audience is. Generally, the ones who prefer online education are tech-savvy, urban people and they should be able to shell out 400 rupees a month. But they'll probably form a minority, compared to the total number of students in India. Most of Indian students are in mid-sized to small towns, where 400 rupees is a big amount and parents would think twice before spending. [To give you an anecdote about spending, Spotify gives student memberships at 60 rupees a month, and all my urban friends think it's a really good deal, while a lot of my small town friends still prefer to pirate it for free.]


But at the same time if the product is worth it, Indian parents are a sucker for anything education related. But you'll have to work hard to establish that trust.  You can have a look at BYJU's - they do a lot of teaching online and they've gotten loads of funding.

As if demo isn't a good example of that.",1544618818.0,"It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

804,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",0,d931fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/,0,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",1569445691.0,,Business/Finance

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",1586098195.0,"I would especially like to emphasize page 99 onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of SDRMF is given. Some people were complaining that why Kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to Maharashtra. There were several speculations and baseless theories (eg- north-south discrimination) but none of the critical comments, in my knowledge, mentioned about the finance commission recommendations, which is the actual reason. None of them bothered to critique the recommendations.

I think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by XV-FC in allocation of state share of SDRMF funds. People critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page 99 onwards. This will help them base their criticism on actual facts, rather than their imagination.",Business/Finance

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",1586237386.0,"i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy. this would protect you from any fall out as things aren't in your control. this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything, whether they are an employer or employee. also,  working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said, they don't pay enough attention to work; inefficiencies are high, there are leaks within the workflow process. the system is far from decent, let alone perfect. i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else.

from one small bujiness man to another, let the dust settle. you cannot do anything now since nothing is in your control. talk to your vendors and customers. make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs. this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you're aware of the issues you'll have to deal with once things open up.

you also have a lot of free time since there's no activity. work on yourself and your company now. look inwards. take assessment of your processes, see where you can improve workflow, focus on efficiency. with not much happening in the world, this is an excellent time to introspect since we wouldn't get time otherwise when things are busy (without disrupting operations).

I would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you. you're only as good as your team. if you're taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations aren't affected, you're more likely helping him and not yourself. it isn't your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you're paying for.  use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do. make some phone calls, talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices. you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work. this would iron out all the problems you're facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over.

feel free to DM. i love to talk to fellow businessmen :)I don't have any advice that would help you. I just wanna say, be strong. This too shall pass!Stay in there buddy, you're young and that fire will bring you out. Whatever happens, don't quit,",Business/Finance

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",1584245186.0,"They did the same thing in 2018, when crude oil prices fell, they increased taxes on petrol and diesel.

I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.

   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

### 10) Corporates join Ganga Rejuvenation effort

* A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), State Program Management Group-Uttarakhand (SPMG-UK) and Indorama Charitable Trust (ICT) to work together for renovation/ development of the Ghat at Badrinath and Ghats and Crematoria at Gangotri in Uttarakhandat a total cost of 26.64 Crore.
* Rivers in India have always been considered sacred and the Ganga river, in particular, is the identity and lifeline of India. Pilgrim sites and urban centers have developed along the river. These centers have drawn sustenance from the river and have been thriving over time. Ghats and Crematoria are part of the lifestyle of people and pilgrimages to visit the holy river Ganga play a vital role in strengthening the People-River Connect. Gangotri and Badrinath being part of the Char Dham yatra, are especially important. This MoU is a significant step for improving amenities and sanitation at these holy locations with the underlying spirit of partnership and of private corporates taking responsibility by contributing to the National Mission: Rejuvenation of the sacred river Ganga.
* The Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been developed by M/S WAPCOS, a Govt. of India Enterprise.
   * The activities under the project include:
      * Construction of Bathing Ghats and Crematoria
      * Repair and modernization of existing Ghats and Crematoria

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",1584858280.0,"None of this is new. He has always been doing PR giri only.

This bubble was building up by the time of Congress but Manmohan was very smart. True that loans were high in that time too. But when you are in economic boom you're supposed to give loans to companies and take calculated risk. But now the loans are about 5-6 time higher, unemployment is 45 years high, bad loans have gone 3 to 9%. The bubble have been burst.

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

821,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,119,dwnioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/,43,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?",1573833074.0,"Get a trusted relative or a close friend of him and ask them to explain all what you said to your father. I mean get someone who is true well-wisher of your dad and is someone who your father listens to.Your dad only reason for opening school is to gain social influence among his peers and community. 

I don't think he will stop this madness until he is starved of his savings .

If he was so concerned about kids , he would have funded underprivileged children education rather than starting a school.Just make sure he doesn't start contacting any European women while he's at it.",Business/Finance
822,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",60,ee6xey,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/,28,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

Debt advice!!,18,dyxvph,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dyxvph/guys_i_need_help_debt_advice/,26,"I don't know much about running a business.My father has mortgaged our house to finance his business and has taken out a loan close to a crore, to get it running. This has induced a lost of paranoia in the house as my mom thinks that she has been made the Co applicant in the loan and is afraid that if the business fails she will lose all her retirement benefits.   My father claims that she is not the co applicant since it's a mortgage loan and she signed in a paper where it said that she won't lay any claim to the property. I keep asking my dad to show her the papers but he bypasses it somehow and when I say that we will go and speak to the bank manager about this he says that it might affect his relationship with the bank and the loan might not get renewed and it means the end of his business. He has recently invested in two different business in the last 4 months which are yet to generate considerable profits. Now he is asking me to be a co applicant in 25 lakh rupees loan for another business which he says he will get back the money in a week. But you see before i step into this mess i want to know what is what and this time Im willing to trust only real figures and official papers. But i dont know how to. So the things I want to know.

1)What are the financial liabilities of my mom in relation to my dad's business?

2)How do i know a)The current state of my dad's business? b)How much debt has he incurred?

3) How effectively is the loan money is being used?

4) Financially what I'll be putting myself into by becoming the co applicant.",1574258905.0,"First step before investing in any business, not just your Dads. 

Check the account books, This being India he would be keeping two books. One for official tax and the other to hide it. get access to both. If he does not have these details then please do not even invest a rupee.

After checking the books and doing your own analysis of revenue generated and expenses you should have a good idea what state your dads business is at. PLEASE DO THIS ANALYSIS FROM THE START OF THE BUSINESS TILL DATE. 

Second thing is to get a business plan. Tell your dad to provide a business plan, after all he is running the business. Again, if he does not have this dont Invest. 

Third and the most important rule, **NEVER GET INVOLVED IN BUSINESS VENTURES WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.**This is a risky place to be...

If your Dad has a Company/LLP, buy the MCA records of Profit & Loss & balance sheet to know where it stands.

However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth.

833,"The impact of GST on invoicing, and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in India - exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now",79,d4mq0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d4mq0p/the_impact_of_gst_on_invoicing_and_thus_on/,46,"tl;dr

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

So far, I'd only read handwavy statements like ""GST is a ""game-changer"""" from ivory tower economists, but voices on the ground like yours are the ones that show reality. 

This line in particular surprised me:

>Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state.

It's fcked up that govt expects a service provider to have registered office in every state of the client.I know it's too long. I wanted to do justice to the issue. I got tired of writing it lol but I've tried to put down as many details as possible to explain it the anyone who reads it. I know the formatting is fucked. I'll fix that later too.This is very good, even with the occasional oversimplification. You explained everything clearly.

Having to maintain GST registrations in multiple states (especially for service companies, where the service is usually delivered over the internet, without any goods moving from one state to another) is a huge pain.

&#x200B;

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years.

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here?

837,Will India embrace blockchain?,3,e8as8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e8as8b/will_india_embrace_blockchain/,2,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

840,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory",8,dlf5x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dlf5x8/pakodanomics_olauber_theory_box_office_theory/,4,"So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems. Sadly many of them think it is their fate rather than the failure of governments.",1571763371.0,"First of all to the effort you put in. Kudos.

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",1567596462.0,"if you have the 'cover' of a reasonably relaxed job, use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market.

Look for a confluence of personal interest (in acquiring a skill) and that  skill having high market value (people will pay you money for that skill).

Good Luck.Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

> The election commission has capped expenditure of candidates fighting parliamentary and assembly polls. The limits vary from state to state.

[In Andhra politics, pastor K A Paul has generated enough confusion to gain some ground](https://indianexpress.com/elections/andhra-pradesh-elections-k-a-paul-praja-shanthi-party-5648582/)

> The PSP could at best be an also-ran in Andhra politics with not much traction on the ground, but it is now garnering attention for some peculiar reasons. Jagan’s YSR Congress Party has complained to the Election Commission **that the party had fielded at least 35 assembly candidates with names similar to their own candidates.** For example. in Ongole constituency, Jagan’s party has Balineni Srinivas Reddy and Paul’s party has Balineni Srinivasa Rao as their candidate.

> If you think this is not confusing enough, Paul’s election symbol, the helicopter with its rotor blades, when seen in a smaller size could be eerily similar to the fan symbol of Jagan’s party. Add to that the fact that colours of the party flag too are similar.

What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues.

FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?

Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

Yes, you can. no permision or licences are required.

>do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

>do i need to pay rent to parents.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

NO

>do i need current account.

It is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k 

If you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me. You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. 

Get sales first. Everything comes after that.

862,Broke up 30! What next???,14,al2pdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/al2pdh/broke_up_30_what_next/,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;",1548813778.0,"Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage. * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!

[Long]",34,9pj0at,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/,19,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",1539977979.0,"Glad your family situation is better. Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this? 

Any degree is good. B. Com should be good if you plan a business in future or pursue further studies like MBA/CA. ",Business/Finance

&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

",1542724145.0,"Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this isHere's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

Yes, it's a pain to use multiple apps, something JD is promising to solve. But I've never seen anyone use JD regularly. Yes, I've also logged in once, maybe a few years ago and found it severely lacking in comparison to google, and left it.

Next comes the part about Financing. I think that JD is charging businesses to list themselves, but why would anyone pay? The app has a very small user base I recon.

872,The Kerala Model,137,79u1il,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/79u1il/the_kerala_model/,159,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.  [Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/not-rank-state-wants-kerala-high-unemployment-we-need-more-entrepreneurs-govt-says-61216)



3. Political Violence and the most fertile ground for ISIS recruitment in India. [Kerala tops the crime rate list, with 16.3 riot cases per lakh people, followed by Bihar (12.9) and Karnataka (10.6).](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/327-rise-in-agrarian-riots-in-2015-NCRB-report-shows/article14598321.ece) [How Isis recruiters found fertile ground in Kerala, India's tourist gem.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/isis-recruiters-fertile-ground-kerala-indias-tourist-gem)



4. Second last in Ease of Doing Business Ranking amongst the general category (removing the somewhat isolated NE states, troubled J&K and small Union Territories besides Delhi) and 20th rank across India. [Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state. (That's cool, I have no issues with alcohol.)



7. Dire position of the State Finances: [Five charts that explain the crisis in Kerala’s economy.](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/HkujNa0LphyCVSoqFFIEWK/Five-charts-that-explain-the-crisis-in-the-Kerala-economy.html) They even exceeded the Fiscal Deficit Targets which they had committed too.







2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014. 



____



I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.

As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.

03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???

Please share any other information which are useful.",1541955209.0,"> 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? 

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

&#x200B;

> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? 

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B;

> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

again, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there

&#x200B;

> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? 

I'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure

&#x200B;

> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. 

Cleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents

&#x200B;

> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? 

not sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need

&#x200B;

> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? 

most big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%

&#x200B;

> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? 

Please search ""canada express entry"" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days

&#x200B;

> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. 

There are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has ""pleasant"" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.

&#x200B;

To summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.

&#x200B;Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision.Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate.

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.",1521239786.0,"Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.

On the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's.What are the top 25 institutions?",Business/Finance
876,"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

 ______ 
**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** 

 ______ 
A senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after
he got a call from goods and services tax (

GST

) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the
construction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for
the executive to explain that the word ""stone"" in the brand name had nothing
to do with the business the firm was into.

Few kilometres away from the PE firm's office in

Mumbai

, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was
nervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's

GST assessing officer

, and it left him in knots.

""How does one explain credit

swap

ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?"" he asked his
chartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some
queries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.

As the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of
erstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies
are running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with
manufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with
service companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.

But under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared
and all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile
VAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.

Many of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately
asking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.

""There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to
voice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing
authorities.

Several service providers, whose business models are well known to the central
authorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are
apprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on
taxation of services,"" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte

India

.

Industry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment
officers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair
like in the case of income tax. ""One has to deal with officials for refunds,
credits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some
time before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,"" the senior
finance executive in the PE firm said.

The government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and
dividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just
for PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.

Take the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about
Rs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials
for the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.

Another diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out
an SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants
former state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.

The manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his
assessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are
somewhat unfounded. ""Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of
changing their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has
undergone training and there is no need to worry,"" a government official in
the know clarified.

""Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods
and they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials
were given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried
several services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,"" said
Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,

KPMG India

.

The worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a
complex subject. ""One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because
the tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,"" he laughs. ""However, I
would say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they
don't understand, and it may just be a good thing.""

But not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions
which are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The
tax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the
firm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know
how come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for ""merely
talking for half an hour"" from a client, but not charging anything from
another client with whom she had spoken for two hours.

""It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is
complex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were
allotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,"" a senior tax
advisor said.

881,TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,543,6s4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s4hoh/tldr_godman_to_tycoon_the_untold_story_of_baba/,95,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. ",1502127309.0,"Dude, thank you. This was really good. When you mentioned in that thread I knew I'd never read the book but I did want to know a gist.  [OP that delivers is the best kind of OP](http://i.imgur.com/Tyu0M4y.jpg).

PS, Author's take on this book:

> [I’d be Naive Not to Worry About a Fallout](https://www.thequint.com/books/2017/07/31/priyanka-pathak-narain-author-of-explosive-ramdev-biography)

Really good interview. >Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR.

Ramdev is a shady dudeThanks. I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.

**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)

It's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief.",Business/Finance

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

**Even tax officers left foxed by GST form - Times of India** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: A few weeks ago, amid the furore over a massive rise in compliance burden due to GST , the government decided to do a reality check. It set up a few computers and asked several indirect tax officers involved with conceptualisation and implementation of the new regime to try filling up the forms themselves.While there were a few who managed to complete the task, there were several who had difficulty doing what they had been asking businesses to do all over the country. ""Those who were computer-savvy managed to do it but there were some who took time,"" said a source, confirming the development.Suddenly, officers seemed to become aware of complications with the three-stage filing process. ""It seemed there was a sudden change of heart, officers became sympathetic to something they were refusing to acknowledge for months despite complaints,"" said a revenue service officer.The change in mood in the government is apparent with the revenue department and the Central Board of Excise and Customs becoming more responsive to change. But before the officers took the test, the feedback in an internal survey wasn't too favourable either. A survey of businessmen was limited to Gujarat and Haryana and the overwhelming impression was that the process was too cumbersome.Small traders are complaining that GST has resulted in a split between fathers and sons and between brothers — with one of them taking care of the business, while the other handles compliance. The culprit is seen to be requirement to upload elaborate returns every month, then match the invoices uploaded by sellers before the final returns are filed and tax is paid.While the GST Council, comprising state finance ministers and headed by union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, has allowed quarterly filing of returns by businesses with annual turnover of up to Rs 1.5 crore, a panel of five state finance ministers has recommended that change should be extended to all companies.Simultaneously, efforts are afoot to improve the functioning of the GST Network, the portal that is used for registration of entities, filing of returns and payment of taxes. Several glitches have been identified and Infosys, the vendor the project, has been asked to tone up, said officials.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love.

FORMER FINANCE minister P Chidambaram on Saturday lashed out Modi government, saying demonetisation and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have destroyed the country’s economy, forcing small and medium business to shut down. Interacting with businessmen in Rajkot, the senior Congress leader said demonetisation was not a bold step, but a reckless one. “What’s a bold step? A farmer who commits suicide is also taking a bold step. Do you welcome it? Committing suicide also requires courage. I call it rash, reckless and adventurous step. You call it bold and beautiful. But the point is it has destroyed lives. For nearly two to three months, millions of people stood and waited in queues to exchange their (currency) notes. Nearly,140 people lost their lives. Carpenters, rickshaw pullers, plumbers who depend on daily earning in cash went without business for two months. Demonetisation was a foolish step,” Chidambaram said at an event named Samvad, which was organised by a local Gujarati newspaper.

Chidambaram also took a dig at the government, saying the note ban has failed to achieve all its stated objectives like putting an end to black money, curbing terror funding etc. “There is nothing like black money but merely income which is taxed and income which is taxable but escapes tax net. There is a shadow economy (in India) but there is shadow economy in every other country. India’s shadow economy that is transactions that don’t come under tax net is around 12 per cent. But that’s average for Europe also. There are many European countries which have shadow economy of more than 12 per cent. Even America has around eight per cent shadow economy. What is shadow economy? It is income that your tax system is not able to capture. The answer to shadow economy is to make your tax system more efficient. If you put cruel rates of tax, people will avoid it. People will say why should I pay… If you make friendly tax system, they will pay. The answer is not demonetisation. It’s like saying there is a mosquito in my house, I am going to burn my whole house,” he said.

He added that the introduction of GST in its present form has destroyed small and medium business as requirement for online filing three returns online per month had forced them had forced them to shut down. He said these businesses were job-creators. “If you invest Rs1 crore in big business it won’t create jobs. But small and medium businesses which create jobs are struggling for survival. Therefore, they are not hiring and no jobs are created,” he added.

Chidambaram also claimed that the demonetisation and the roll-out of GST had dealt a severe blow to the economy, sending it into a downward spiral. However, he said, the government maintains that the economy is in fine fettle. “Day before yesterday, the Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) said the Indian economy is on strong micro economic fundamentals. And the finance secretary said it was growing at 7.5 per cent, between 2014 and 2017. Why are they announcing Rs 5 lakh crore Bharatmala? Why are you announcing bank recapitalisation all of a sudden. In your heart, you know things are not good. In the last six quarters, the growth rate has gone down from 9.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent. This means a drop of 3.4 per cent,” said the Congress.

The former finance minister opined that it was possible to overcome the situation by “taking right steps and not taking wrong steps”. He said that he has faith that there are people in the country who can take right steps. “The growth rate must not go down below 5.6 per cent. India doesn’t deserve growth rate below 5.7 per cent, and it is possible to take it up by taking right steps and not taking wrong steps. But for that to happen, the government must acknowledge that they committed a mistake by demonetisation and GST. There are people in this country who can do this. Government must hire from outside to correct the mistakes. Those in government can’t do it as they are the ones who have committed the mistakes,” Chidambaram added.

He claimed that 1,326 farmers committed suicide in Gujarat over the last four years. “There are no jobs today. Jobs will be created only if small and medium businesses grow. To help them grow, small businesses should not require to register. Medium businesses must register but they should be given right to self-certification,” said the Congress leader. He said the government was talking about vikas (development). “People talk about growth. Growth is necessary. But what is the use of rojgar-mukta vikas (development sans job creations)” he asked.

The Congress leader also accused the NDA government of misplaced priorities. “They will invest Rs1 lakh crore on bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. How many people will travel in it. Around 300 or 400? Can’t we give Rs1 crore to each school so that new buildings are built, toilets are built, teachers are hired. Our priority is education, health, employment,” he said.

**Deutsche Bank bets on India; zeroes in on bad-loan cleanup to generate outsized returns** 

 ______ 
Deutsche Bank had 15.2 billion euros (.7 billion) of credit risk exposure in
India as of December, making up about 16 percent of its total across Asia-
Pacific markets, according to its 2017 annual report. (Reuters)

Deutsche Bank AG, which is in the throes of a global restructuring involving
thousands of job cuts, is zeroing in on an Asian market where an unprecedented
bad-loan clean-up offers the potential for a credit bonanza.

In India, where bankruptcy law changes have injected urgency into efforts to
restructure $210 billion of stressed assets, Deutsche Bank sees an opportunity
to generate outsized returns by refinancing and trading debt, according to
Amit Khattar, Asia-Pacific co-head of global credit trading. Khattar is
considering adding to his team.

“For India, this is where we think the greatest alpha lies for our credit and
financing businesses in the region,” Singapore-based Khattar said in an
interview. “We want to get involved in most of the major deals out there. The
bank has no constraint in terms of scaling up in this area if there’s an
opportunity to grow the business.”

Speculators are flocking to India, lured by what the nation’s richest banker
has called a “once in a lifetime” opportunity to sift through the wreckage of
its bad-loan debacle. Deutsche Bank is already a force there: much of its
Asian credit exposure is in India, and the nation accounts for the second-
biggest share of regional profits.

The bank plans to team up with other firms to arrange financing for Indian
debtors, Khattar said. It’s looking for partners to offer debtor-in-possession
funding — which can keep a business operating during bankruptcy proceedings —
as well as for structuring equity and debt financing for companies before they
slip into difficulty.

Khattar manages more than 100 people in his Asia-Pacific team, which provides
working capital to companies and trades debt on secondary markets. Headcount
has been stable in the past four years, and any addition isn’t expected to be
massive, he added.

He shares the team responsibility with Tokyo-based Beaux Pontak and both of
them report to global head of credit trading Chetankumar Shah in Singapore,
the bank said.

Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank is cutting at least 7,000 jobs as new Chief
Executive Officer Christian Sewing seeks to end three straight years of
losses. The firm dismissed four traders in the U.S. who focused on debt
markets, and Chris Lahoud, the head of the distressed team, is leaving, people
with knowledge of the matter said last week. In Asia, it’s trimming some
equity sales and derivatives coverage, Bloomberg reported last month.

**India Exposure**

Deutsche Bank had 15.2 billion euros ($17.7 billion) of credit risk exposure
in India as of December, making up about 16 percent of its total across Asia-
Pacific markets, according to its 2017 annual report. That included lending
commitments and traded bonds and debt. By comparison, Japan accounted for 17.3
billion euros while China and Hong Kong made up 16.5 billion euros.

This year alone, Indian lenders are racing to rehabilitate more than 4
trillion rupees ($58 billion) of troubled loans, as the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code in 2016 and banking rules force defaulters to pay up or
restructure. From Canadian pension funds to Asian investment banks, more
capital has flowed into lending, rescue financing and trading of distressed
securities.

Recent debt restructuring cases in India have involved some of the nation’s
biggest companies, including Reliance Communications Ltd., Essar Steel Ltd.
and Bhushan Steel Ltd. Many of the biggest bankruptcy cases are running behind
schedule, however, hit by issues ranging from a shortage of judges to legal
challenges. There are more than 2,500 bankruptcy cases wending their way
through 10 insolvency courts in India’s notoriously slow legal system.

Global private equity firms, special-situation investors, distressed-debt
traders and banks are converging on India, including Apollo Capital Management
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The likes of Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Varde
Partners Inc. are prowling for more.

“The bankruptcy code is a significant development which would generate
considerable opportunities in debt resolution,” Khattar said. “Company owners
also want to retain their business and see long-standing debt issues resolved.
All these need structuring and capital.”

891,[RANT] SBI worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed,50,7yvec1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yvec1/rant_sbi_worker_blames_me_for_faulty_transactions/,59,"I received a message today about being credited with some 12k on my SBI account which confused me. Checked my online SBI account and realised that a week back some Google Octro had made a transaction of that 12k from my account which I had not realised. A simple google search showed that a lot of SBI customers were also complaining about this Google Octro thing (also found a TOI article on it). Its an App on the Google Play store from what I understood. But never mind that, I was just thankful I got my money back. However, a quick advice from my father was to close my SBI account because the Octro company may still have my account details and such, so there might be a risk of such fraudulent or faulty or whatever transactions to occur again. I've never taken the time to manage my finances or understand how fraud transactions work so this part is probably my fault because I realised a week late that 12k was even missing from my account in the first place. So I went to the bank to close my account and maybe create a new account after that.

Now I am not confrontational, and I even see my faults in the whole thing. But the man behind the desk was a whole different story. When I went and old him I'd like to close my account, he looked up the statement of my transactions. And I pointed out the faulty ones and he started blaming me for those.

He used a shitty ass analogy and I quote ""if a pick pocket steals from a person and the person doesn't realise then the blame lies on the person for not realising."" Yea right the pickpocket is the angel here for stealing from a man carrying a wallet. What the fuck is this victim blaming nonsense?? 

He told me I can't blame the bank for not realising I lost money. Except I didn't even blame the bank. I only told him I wanted to close my account and gave him the reason when he asked why??

And then I told him I have been busy with things plus my card was with my parents too during that time so I didn't properly check my account frequently and I realise that its my fault. And then he was like ""of course its your fault. Computer won't make mistakes it'll only do what its told, so if there was a mistake in telling it what to do then you should've realised and complained."" 

And then the icing on the cake was that he went on ""You youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing WhatsApp yet you didn't check the transaction message. I know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga. Tumhi ne nahi dekha."" All this after I explained that I know it was my fault that I didn't realise.

Why are office workers in India so rude? This may seem like a small thing for many of you but I hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible. I even admitted the blame on my part and I didn't even lodge a complaint or anything but they still decide to aggressively blame and mock me for being irresponsible? lol and SBI is definitely not at all at fault even though plenty of their customers had actually suffered cause of this Google Octro fiasco.

My experience with SBI so far had been pretty decent until this incident. But now I'm just going to go ahead and get my account closed and move to another bank.

tl:dr SBI account had fraudulent transaction, got blamed for being irresponsible",1519157180.0,"SBI employee here.. I am a 25 yr oldie working in a metro branch in Kolkata.

**Stand-up India: Key to developing entrepreneurs from underprivileged sections of society is mentoring** 

 ______ 
Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood.

Indian startups have captured global attention, attracted venture capital and achieved notable success in recent years. Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.

Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India’s youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.

In the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.

You may also like to watch:

Helping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.

Mentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.

Another example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.

Such handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.

Shanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‘Vivikura’. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.

We have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.

Under the Government’s MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.

893,We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",1494883276.0,"Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts).How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit?We need daily sax thread flair",Business/Finance

 ______ 
Fitch Rating (Representational Image) Fitch Rating (Representational Image)

Despite a continued pitch from the government and corporates for an upgrade, global rating agency Fitch Ratings has kept its sovereign rating on India unchanged, citing weak public finances. In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India’s strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government’s finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India’s sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India’s rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.

India’s long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‘BBB-’. “India’s sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government’s structural reform agenda,” it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, “Why is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.”

“Italian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,” he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India’s ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‘BBB’ median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.

Fitch said India’s economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‘BBB’ range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‘BBB’ median of 58th percentile).

An official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. “It remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is “largely a tax non-compliant society”, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government’s FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,” Fitch said.

“Significant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector’s non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,” it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.

895,India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,9,9zgjc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/,4,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.

Also, faster rates of growth, education, gender equality etc etc.Playing the devil’s advocate: is there any analysis to prove that administrative efficiency is directly proportional to size of state?

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

2. Next week the harvest season will begin for India’s most staple wheat crop. In all probability, shortage of hands for harvesting wheat could lead to rotting of the crop in the fields. 
3. In France, acute shortage of seasonal labour to harvest crops has prompted the government call unemployed to help farmers.
4. In the US, the virus has sent farm workers, half of whom are undocumented migrant labourers, uncovered by $2 trillion stimulus, into panic

Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

**Will you too show the paper?**


When the wisdom of the kings is shabby,

then the police are equally barbaric.

Today Ayashi is soaked with blood,

Will you get your children beaten tomorrow?


**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
When Shaheen's nights tremble,

The grannies chant ""Inquilab"".

That cold chill in those old fingers,

Will you let your mother feel that tomorrow?

**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
When they go to my ancestral home,

Men-in-uniforms sabotage everything

Today my streets have become ashes,

Will you let your city burn tomorrow?

**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
Sagir-Bilal died of body,

Gopal-Kapil died of mind.

If there is still silence in your eyes,

Will you look into your kid's eyes tomorrow?

**Will you too show the paper?**
  
  
We all are his children, he says

then why is there bloodshed in his name?

In this twisted business of religion,

Will you let your descendants die?

**Will you too show the paper?**I'm not educated in gauging a poetry, but I can understand the sentiments and I firmly apreciate them.Nicely written bro!",CAA-NRC-NPR

Instead what we have now is a system that threatens every single move we make because others are ALLOWED by us to use their powers against us!

I think the CAA, NRC, NPR protest is at a stage now that it can be used to rope in related issues and expand the reach of protests to meet demands which should have been granted to us long ago.

The Expanded Five point demand by protesters should be :-

1. Roll back CAA. Population census is fine (under Census Act 1948), it does not come under the ambit of Citizenship Act of 1955. However, NPR and NRIC do come under the ambit of Citizenship Act - the government should say that they do not intend to go through with the exercise of NPR and NRIC in their current term - until 2024.
2. Jobs, water and affordable food - where are ""achche din""? This was all promised by the government.
3. Ban EVM from all forms of elections in India - only paper ballots.
4. Police involved in manhandling of CAA protesters and breaking protester's property should be indicted in fast trial courts.
5. State government should compensate families of victims abused by the police.

\-1) \[Coz fuck you Natural Numbers\] Govt is trying to give these protests a communal angle. DONT fall for their trap. Many international news have also claimed this being anti-muslim, try to clear things as much as possible. Assam wants every illegal migrant out, be it Muslim, Hindu or Sikh. And I support that. But everyone should be given fair trial and Govt should give those legal citizens of India which are not in NRC full support to procure documents of proof. 

CAA+NRC+NPR are not Anti-Muslim, they are Anti-India and Anti-Constitution. **Our founding fathers i.e. Mahatma Gandhi, Patel, Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Maulana Azad, Sukhdev, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Bhimrao Ambedkar, Neta Ji and many many more, all wanted a Secular India and they formulated this Constitution (and Article 14 in that) and set the guideline for the future course of our nation. We owe our Freedom to them and we should respect their Principles**. By going against the spirit of our Constitution we are disrespecting them. If we start questioning their decisions, then we have gone too astray and are not worth being called an Indian.

1) Go through this article to understand what is going on **behind the scenes at BJP HQ**. How they are planning to communalize the country.

[https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims](https://thewire.in/media/cab-bjp-whatsapp-groups-muslims)

2) Also, keep in mind that the new evil is NPR, a rebranded NRC exercise. They have added 2 new questions to the census-based on Nationality of Parents and details of Passport

3) Data Protection Bill has already been introduced in Lok Sabha. Go through it. Summary at  [https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/policy/personal-data-protection-bill-2019-central-government-power-may-undermine-privacy-of-citizens-people/story/392186.html)  I think after we get success on CAA we should continue the momentum and protest on other issues as well.

4) I don't have any personal experience of getting beaten by Lathis, though I have participated in protests earlier in my life. I would suggest the protestors to wear at least 4-5 layers of thick clothing so as to minimize the effect of Lathis. Heck, we are a nation of Cricket fanatics.. why don't we wear Helmets and Cricket Pads underclothes and protest? 

5) For past few days, while having a discussion with fairly educated people, I saw some of the biases in these people eg. Muslims are bad people (*Eureka!*), Muslims have beard (*WTF? Sikhs have too, so you'll go behind them next?*), Muslims are extremists, America also censors them (*US censors a lot of other people too for eg your Kaka*),  [Hindus went from 23% to 7% in Pak, which is false](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-bangladesh-non-muslim-population-citizenship-amendment-bill-bjp-1627678-2019-12-12)  ( [Another report, choose which one you want to believe](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50720273) ) . It's pretty normal to have bias and I don't blame these people as I too had these bias at some point of time but then sense prevailed. Any community of people looks at another community with suspicion, and when most of the Political and Film fraternity has been painting you with a single colour, it is bound to happen. 

Don't let this narrative get to you. **Bad people are there in every religion**, be it Christians, Hindus, Muslims or Sikh or even Buddhists. There are Christian terrorists, sikh terrorists, hindu terrorists, buddhist terrorists and muslim terrorists. Just because there are terrorists in some religion doesn't mean all the followers of that religion are evil or terrorists. 

6) This whole fucking exercise is actually bad for Non-muslims. **Rs. 1900 crore has already been spent by State for Assam NRC**. Govt has cut Rs. 3000 crore from Education budget. What do you estimate it will cost to do the same NRC exercise nationwide. Any guesses? Hint: There are 28 States in India. 

Growth is already low, Inflation is increasing, All sectors are down. It doesn't take a genius to know, such divisions and instigation on communal lines will only lead to communal riots which will affect many innocent Non-muslim and Muslim families country-wide and Govt will not come to their help. 

PS. I am not from Delhi but I am planning to shift to Delhi in January to dedicate myself to active protest and continue the momentum further. Meanwhile, I am trying to help my brothers and sisters on ground by spreading awareness through social media.

Please note that this was in text, and all quotes here are literal, 'as-is' of what I received from them without any tampering. The unquoted ones are mine.

>  
>And  for that, the purpose of CAA came into existence to protect these  minorities from the religious persecution in the hands of majority of  these three countries while giving them Indian citizenship but it  doesn't mean that it bar the entry of any muslim from other countries of  the world, they can seek Indian citizenship under the Citizenship Act  of 1955 and it is wrongly stupid argument that it will stripping the  citizenship of Indian Muslims. It also doesn't mean that it would give  citizenship of India to these persecuted minorities very smoothly, No  never they can attain Indian citizenship only on the basis of the proper  process of naturalisation, if they will failed in this process then  they can't attain the Indian citizenship.  
>  
>Don't interpreted the CAA with **NRC**  because the CAA has nothing to do with NRC, the legal provisions of the  NRC have been part of the Citizenship Act, 1955 since December 2004.  Also there are specific statutory rules of 2003 to operationalise these  legal provisions. They govern the process of registration of Indian  citizens and issuance of national identity cards to them. These legal  provisions have been on the statute book since last 15–16 years. The CAA  has not altered them in any way whatsoever. Don't interpreted it like  that illegal Hindus outside and inside India will be protected via the  CAA and muslims will be discriminated, no not at all, both illegal  Hindus and Muslims claim for Indian citizenship equally via the process  of naturalisation, where CAA will not given blanket protect to Hindus.  
>  
>Don't  interpreted the CAA in the context of Ahmadiyas in Pakistan, hazaras in  Afghanistan and illegal rohingyas in India because Ahmadiyas in  Pakistan are in majority and they believe in the Pakistani version of  Islam and not maintain the level of minority same as hazaras in  Afghanistan stand in the internal context of their governance and  rohingyas are hostile community at international level and they are the  native of the neighbouring countries and they are illegally stable in  India without the citizenship of India and they will be identified under  the NRC for the purpose of deporting at their place.

&#x200B;

The  pretext of your answer assumes that since the countries mentioned in  the CAA (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) have failed to protect  their minorities, and henceforth, failed to keep-up with the  Nehru-Liaquat pact, and since these people might share ancestry  with/were born in pre-1947 India, it’s the responsibility of the Indian  State to protect them.

However, Afghanistan wasn’t a part of the partition, and nor of the Nehru-Liaquat Pact. Why have them under the same belt then?

In  that case, if we’re opening our doors to religiously-persecuted  minorities from other countries (which is a good thing), why not include  Muslims and other non-Hindu minorities from Nepal (which was a Hindu  Rashtra until as late as 2008), and non-Sinhalese people from Sri Lanka?

You  also seem to contradict your statement when it comes to Rohingyas (who  according to Amnesty International, are the most persecuted minority in  the World), Hazaras or Ahmadiya Muslims (you exclude Ugyur Muslims too)  citing that they are Muslims (and thus, constitute majority in their  respective country). Please note that Ahmadiyas aren’t even considered  Muslims in Pakistan, and CAA can, very flexibly, be extended to support them.

Why is it a factor for us that they belong to the majority?

Let me tell you - because, as of current version of CAA, it does NOT mention *“religious persecution”*  at all. It just says that if you belong to <INSERT ALLOWED  RELIGIONS>, and were in India in b/w <INSERT DATES>, you shall  be offered Indian citizenship.

Now, if they’d include Muslims too, entire citizenry of Pakistan would have a free pass to Indian citizenship.

I’m  all in for greater humanitarian interests of supporting refugees, but  all of this evidence points out that this step from government is a  petty tactic for winning the Bengal elections (by the support from  Bangladeshi Hindus and other immigrants).

>**Irrelevant Argument related with the Violation of the Articles of the Constitution of India——**  
>  
>There  is argument of the constitutional obligation on CAA then understand it  broadly, there is no any provision of CAA has been violated any articles  of the Constitution of India include Article 14 as well. Understand  it---  
>  
>**Article 14** (**Come** **under** **Part-3** **of** **the** **Indian** **Constitution**) doesn't  deal with the part of citizenship that obliging towards the status of  citizenship, the purpose of Article 14 check implied where equals are  treated differently without any reasonable basis. But where equals and  unequal are treated differently, the Article 14 does not mean that all  laws must be general in character. It does not mean that the same laws  should **apply**  to all persons. It does not mean that every law must have universal  application for, all person are not, by nature, attainment or  circumstances in the same position.  
>  
>**Article** **5 to 11** **(under** **PART-2)**  are the only articles of the Constitution of India that deal with the  context of Citizenship, where Article 11 state that it grant of  citizenship shall be subject to any further law that the parliament may  passed in this particular regards, its the only union parliament which  have the power in this particular issue, it is not within the domain of  states. In the context of Citizenship Article 5 to 11 of the  Constitution of India shall read along with the Citizenship Act of 1955  coupled with the foreigners Act of 1946 that deal with the who is the  foreigner of as far as India's concern.

It’s not that this bill is ‘*literally*’  targeting the constitution of India, but it’s hurting it’s principles  of equality in the sense that the Indian Government is judging people  (and I quote you) by *“level of minority”*,  and that too, falsely. Religious discrimination faced against the Tamil  people in Sri Lanka, or the pain of Ugyurs in China is no-less than the  plight of Hindu people in Pakistan.

Also,  you comment that we shouldn’t tie up CAA with NRC. However, there are  two main reasons that I can cite in favor of studying CAA in light of  NRC:

* Firstly, the Home Minister, at least in 7 of his recent speeches, has always spoken of them together.
* Secondly,  and more importantly, because, assuming the NRC pan India will be  similar to assam, it will give extreme discretionary powers to local  authorities, who have the power to claim ANYONE (not Muslims, not  Hindus, not Christians, yes anyone) as ""doubtful citizens"". The basis of  such a conclusion is vague, and hence extremely exploitative. It’s like  giving them \[the Registrar\] a free pass to exploit the poor, or  anyone/any community they hold grudges against. Don’t we already have  enough of it?  
Not to forget, it can be used as a tool to suppress  dissent - If you dare say anything against the government, they’d have  the authority to strip you off of your citizenship. This pain might be  less for non-Muslims because if they are rich, they can hope to claim  citizenship under the CAA (*cough* bribe *cough*).

The  sea of reasons mentioned here are enough for people to oppose a bill.  The NRC is tangential to this discussion, but forms a very important  base of the ongoing protests.

Also,  these protests aren’t just against CAA, or the NRC, or NPR for that  matter. It’s also against the brutality with which the police took  action against the protestors. Among all other things, it is also to  assert our right to dissent, and to assert the fact that people’s  opinion has a rightful place in a democracy, which given the current  government’s stance, they are crumbling. (Just today \[Jan. 3. '20\], Home  Minister said that they wouldn’t move an inch backwards on CAA.)

Enhance your  knowledge and maintain the status of democracy of this nation.  
   
>  
>“CAA is not in the context of stripping the Citizenship of any Indian Citizen and their fundamental rights”  
 

You also wrongly quote the Arabic Kalma - *“La Ilaha Illallah”* sprayed on the wall in Jamia. It literally means *“Ekam brahmasmi, dutiya nasti”*,  which if you’d be Hindu enough to read Brahma Sutra you’d know means,  “There’s just one God. None other.” People might call it 'Brahma',  'Ishwara', 'Bhagwan', 'Allah', 'God', a tree, or whatever - but it’s ultimately one (An idea which is  popular even in a religion such as Hinduism which is known for it’s many  gods – Many Hindu school of thoughts subscribe to worshiping idols, but  the belief across Sanatana Dharma (even in the Nastika philosophy) is  to believe in the absolute - *'Brahmand'*).

Also,  you talk about violence in the protests. I cannot speak for everywhere,  but from the news reports, it seems that most (and the largest)  gatherings against CAA-NRC-NPR are peaceful. Even if there was violence,  the brutality with which the police is reacting doesn’t justify any of  it. (Raping minors, killing people!!).

There  have been reports of how people have been planted in the mob to  instigate violence - you know who this would benefit - definitely, not  the protestors.

In the end, I’d like to quote you:

# First Step - CENSUS [aka NPR]

Some govt. officials will visit your place and will ask you the following questions

1. Your name
2. Your Date of Birth
3. Your parent's name and place of birth
4. Some sort of paper just to confirm your identity, ""NOTHING RELATED TO YOUR CITIZENSHIP"" such as maybe your Aadhar number, Voter ID card.

# Second Step - The D factor [Doubtful Citizen]

After a few months, all the data from NPR will be collected and some Government officials will check the whole list and if you weren't able to answer a few questions such as - Your Parent's exact age, their DoB, your own Aadhar number just because it's been month you applied and haven't received it or any other reason not mentioned here then that official will simply put a ""D"" in front of your name i.e. Doubtful Citizen.

# Third Step - NRC

If your name is in the new filtered list of Doubtful Citizens then you will have to ""Prove your Citizenship""

How?

The government has not published any such guidelines as per now but we can understand from the example of Assam: Aadhar Card, Name in the Voter list, name in Ration card list can nothing prove your Citizenship, It was also said by Amit Shah repeatedly in his speeches and interviews recently.

Source: [https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/](https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/) \[The link also has a video interview, Just in case if you like watching his face and listening to his voice, otherwise believe me and read further\]

You will have to present documents which should prove where you were born 30 years ago if you were not born then you will have to show the documents of your parents or grandparents, any property documents maybe. If you are able to provide the proofs then you are safe, If not then you will be filtered out once again, Hence the 4th step.

# Fourth Step - Foreigners Tribunal

This will be your last chance to prove that you are Citizen of  Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan, If you are Muslim then you stand no chance because CAA will be activated here even if you prove that you were a citizen of any of the above countries. If others are not able to prove their Citizenship then they will also be labeled as Foreigners.

# Fifth Step - Detention Centers [JAIL FOR FOREIGNERS]

6 detention centers are already functioning in Assam, Constructions of detention Centers has already begun in other states.

**~~\[NSFW\]~~**  I typed a long paragraph about the life in the Detention Center but then  I realized that you guys like Truth but do not the BRUTAL HONESTY. So let's skip that part.

# How to stop this 5-step plan?

It's VERY SIMPLE, As soon the government begins with the first step we need to boycott it immediately because once people are filtered out then it will be too easy for the government to handle us because then they have to handle only a few of use and they exactly know which one of us.

You are not alone, ""We the people of India"" is a group formed by more than 120 organizations throughout the country has given a call to boycott the NPR \[Press release attached at the end\]

How to boycott this process:

If officials visit your place then don't be angry on them, They are not Sanghi (some of them might be), They are the government officials who will be doing this government survey, Offer them water, tea, ask them to even have a seat if you would like that but just politely tell them that you won't be sharing any details with them as it is unconstitutional, Don't give any papers, Don't share any information with them verbally. They will try to tell you that it's a Government survey and it's unconstitutional but take a stand and deny the information politely.

Now I know very well that a lot of my fellow Hindu brothers and ~~sisters~~ females might be thinking that I will give them the papers because mom-dad will yell at me but yeah I will stand against this CAA and NPR during protests, I will go to Shaheen Bagh, No way. It won't work that way, The government will start picking up people one by one after that because just for an example If 1000 people are living in a locality then 770 might show papers then they have to handle only 30 people now, They very well know how to handle 30 people.

I am leaving a video in the comments sections, The same concept explained in Hindi by Yogendra Yadav, share that video with your Driver, Servant, Vegetable Vendor or anyone you know might not have the papers despite caring about their religion. It might change someone's perspective.

1045,What's next for the CAA+NPR+NRC protests,12,fbyadg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fbyadg/whats_next_for_the_caanprnrc_protests/,1,"In the aftermath of the Delhi pogrom, the spotlight the protests were occupying seems to be diminishing with every passing day. 

Moreover most of the talk about the pogroms is emotionally charged gossip. The AAP's complicity by not taking any action at all, and failing miserably with connecting with public, is conveniently being neglected. AAP needs to make amends. We can still look up to AAP in the hope that they are unlike BJP.

The onus should not be on the victims to be left to fight for themselves.  When all the institutions of the establishment fail, the civil society must to step in. Some altruistic people are already taking good steps by volunteering relief material but the scale is abysmal. The victims are left at the benevolence of a few, the state is turning away, the judiciary is abdicating from its responsibilities. Like what kinda mess is this. I hope more people can offer help other than just pity and the state addresses the situation with the urgency that it begs. 


Aside from that, we must remind ourselves that the CAA, NPR and NRC monster is still lurking. It hasn't gone away. India isn't in good hands. The establishment is trying too hard to suppress dissent and they seem to get away with every illegal thing they do. They have a great sense of entitlement. But the protests must go on to protect the idea of India our forefathers had envisioned, to protect the values enshrined in our constitution.

This guard was talking to a college kid. He said ""Saale bahar se aake yaha do manjila ghar bana liye hain .. ab sabit karo .. show karna padega isiliye inki fati padi hai (for protestors)."" .. so I could not resist and intervene, asked him how would you prove your citizenship? he said I have adhaar PAN card etc. .. When I told him, this wouldn't work you would have to furnish the birth certificate of not only your’s, but your father’s, and every member of family .. he said I know some Vidhayak ji and went to this Bhokal attitude. I also asked him if he actually believes that landless labours in village and many people in rural areas would have any kind of paper to support their citizenship ?? and how much of corruption, scam would take place … He still kept on denying by presenting his Bhokal of knowing this Vidhayak and “sab nikalwa lunga”.

So the second logic I am presenting is, If PRO NPR/CAA/NRC guys argue that this law is for giving citizenship and not taking away, why do they so vehemently oppose **reservations**?!?!? Because it provides job to the needy and does not takes anyone’s job .. ask any BJP supporter out there and he’ll tell you how much he hates this reservation thing .. and yet he takes this contrasting stand when it comes to NRC/NPR/CAA.",1578667058.0,"They have only filled mind with gobar in past 6 years.

the minority of the total population of the country. There is still the majority of the people who
continue their lives as normal and have not commented on this issue. 
These protests are said to be driven by the youth but the youth we are seeing protesting are only a small fraction of the total youth. Even among the social workers and NGO workers there are only a small fraction of them who are commenting or sharing their support on social media. 
This is a major issue asthese people are uncaring and unconcerned not just about this issue but other major issues unless it directly affects and impacts them. They are also fearful and a bit lazy for not reading up on these issues and thus not understanding their importance and consequences.
There have been attempts during these protests to shame these people into showing their
support however by and large the majority of society still remains quiet and continuing their lives
as usual.
There needs to be more engagement by this section of the society as they cannot be neutral or
unconcerned with the ruling party doing door to door campaigns about the CAA and NRC/NPR
and also encouraging the people to call a number to show their support for it. 
They should thennot complain when the time comes when they are forced to stand in long queues with theirdocuments and told that they can't be put on the NRC/NPR or have to hunt for their documents and pay a huge amount for them to agents and those in the government offices.
 The teachers, concerned workers and others with knowledge on this issue need to engage with the people on this issue and try to get these people more involved or at least more enlightened.",1578409312.0,"Don't use Name Calling (""they are lazy, stupid, ignorant,  etc"")

to get people to do anything. It doesnt work well to motivate anyone (unless you are in a position of authority over them, and they are forced to listen to you then it will work temporarily till they can escape your power and they will keep trying to do so). 

There are better more healthy ways to motivate people. This is the age of information, go find them and then think about your communication strategy.Personally speaking I cared about these protests initially. But these protesters don't want to discuss. Rather, if you don't agree with their idea, you are labeled a ""bhakt"" and shunned. 
Then why would I or anyone who tries to have a different opinion would come out and fight. Talking to a lot of people in my age group (mid 20's), I can confidently say that unless these protester stop taking thing in black or white manner and start considering what others who are in the middle ground have to say, then they are keeping us away from joining them.",CAA-NRC-NPR

This phenomenon has a long-standing precedent with such measures as the 1982 Citizenship Law in Burma stripping the Rohingya of their rights as citizens. Without citizenship rights, minority communities are left to face further persecution and violence by both governments and non-state actors. In particular, government efforts to strip religious minorities of their citizenship can be a key predictor of mass atrocities.[deleted]",CAA-NRC-NPR

1082,Watched 'Kaala' (2018) starring Rajnikanth and I think it is one of the most revolutionary movies from Indian cinema.,8,ez53oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ez53oq/watched_kaala_2018_starring_rajnikanth_and_i/,11,"Just watched yesterday after recommendation from a friend and got blown by the hidden symbolism and references which pans all issues and the roots behind  which our country is facing .
It is one of the few movies where you need to watch it frame by frame to understand the metaphor which the director wants to convey albeit in a mass movie style.


Rajinikanth and his aura might be at the centre, but the focus is Ranjith’s ideology that operates in the nooks and corners of the screen where our eyes might not usually wander

The film opens to crowded bylanes of Dharavi, with a voiceover detailing the struggles of its inhabitants, the “urban poor”, who were jotted on the margins of the success story of Mumbai and just like that, with the flip of a page, forgotten. Numerous buildings will come up in Dharavi, its denizens are told, bringing modernity and prosperity to their lives. But its people don’t want a 225-square foot cell masquerading as advancement; they want their own freedoms.


It is an anti caste and Ambedkarite movie but unlike other movies  the protagonist kaala here is a fighter who wears all black which he calls the colour of struggle,of hard work. 

The antagonist Hari Dev (Nana patekar )is a Modi like figure who consider himself as the saviour Rama ,dresses all white  and  fantasize  a clean,digital  and pure India at the expense of decimating the lower class. 

Kaala represents the dark, poor precarious world whereas Hari Dada’s neat, clean, white milieu is used as a mask to hide his malicious criminal psyche.

Kaala delves into lives and cultures, and shows us that contrary to the perception of ‘unclean’ – if at all there is anything ‘clean’ about the Indian city, it is thanks to them. The film, in the spirit of Baldwin, repeats that the way people treat you is testament to their own fear and inhumanity, and not your own inferiority.

The colour of black ( Periyar) ,Blue ( Ambedkar) ,Red( Karl marx) is beautifully portrayed in the climax .

Kaala is not only a display of alternative social symbols but it also builds a radical political alternative against the bourgeois rightwing politics of the current times. It showcases the growing democratic consciousness of the Lower Castes, religious minorities, women and other working class people in the depraved land of Dharavi. The films at its core represent the idea of democratic socialism. It retold the epical battle between the haves and have not’s in an actual sociological space",1580912590.0,"I felt this was an overused theme in Tamil cinema . Aren't there too many movies with similar themes starting from the 80sHere your 'Kaala (2018)' being enabler for fascist regime,

1088,I rant.,17,fl5toc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fl5toc/i_rant/,8,"This is just an expression of my personal opinions; if you disagree, I would like to listen to your opinion as well.

Firstly, I wish everyone good health and safety during this pandemic. Now that the entire country is virtually locked down, protests have stopped, and now is the time for introspection.

* I have a feeling that the protests are aiming at the wrong thing. Yes, the CAA-NPR-NRC is extremely diabolical and dictator-like; yes, it is going to choke an already suffocating Indian economy. But, there is something that the BJP-RSS have successfully diverted attention from. It is extremely unpleasant that this is not receiving the required attention.
* On February 14, 2019, a JeM terrorist rammed an explosive laden truck into a group of CRPF jawans, killing 40 of our dear soldiers. On 26 February, the Indian Government ordered an airstrike on Pakistan, an unprecedented move, in retaliation. The next day, the newspapers reported the Government's claims: the airstrikes purportedly killed 300 terrorists in a ""high-tech and luxurious"" camp, with swimming pools, etc.
* A Reuters report suggested that the airstrikes did nothing; the high-tech camp turned out to be a run down madrasa, the bombings barely damaged the madrasa, and there certainly weren't any ""300"" terrorists. BJP rode to power exploiting an anti-Pakistan emotion and romanticising the Indian Military, something that the Opposition could not oppose the BJP on, considering the election time and the sensitivity.
* Around two months ago, Dy.SP Davinder Singh was caught with terrorists. You just need to search his name up on Google to find out everything. When he was posted in Shopian in 2017, a terrorist attack took place. Worse, he was posted at *Pulwama* when the 14 February attack took place. The manner in which the NIA, headed by Y.C. Modi (who gave a clean chit to the cunt Modi for the 2002 riots), snatched the case from the J&K Police is extremely unsettling, as the J&K Police are capable of taking up such a case, considering the security status of J&K. Furthermore, even on the godi media channels, this issue was toned down heavily, signifying one thing - *the BJP-RSS combine knew about this and worse, they could have planned it.*
* They certainly planned it. They either let the Pulwama attack take place or planned it themselves. The fact that they used the Balakot strikes as an election strategy proves that they didn't chance upon the opportunity - it was months in the making. This is extremely dangerous, because we have two obese cunts with every desire to stay in power - even if it means treason or death. We also know that all the planning is done at Nagpur (RSS HQ) meaning there definitely was RSS's hand in it as well.
* We need to step up our vigil and bring this issue to light. Why haven't we heard an udpate since then? Why is it that even after a year, the govt. is unable to apprehend the Pulwama suspects?Now that our only means is social media, we **must** step up our pressure on the Government. A few ways to do that are: do no argue with RSS trolls on social media, flood the feed with questions, reports, anything you find. Do not waste time or energy retweeting or giving unnecessary attention to bigoted statements of attention-seeking whores.
* Secondly, Shaheen Bagh has to disperse. They cannot stay there, especially during a pandemic. It's a risk to their health and gives an opportunity to stoke hatred for them again. We must appeal to them to disperse; it will be in the interest of the true spirit of the country.
* Thirdly, it is 100% true that the only party that has the capability to oppose the BJP is the Congress. But not with fucking Rahul Gandhi. Let him get another time to prove his shot, not now. Scindia's defection should be an eye-opener. We *have* to pressurise the Congress to purge itself of the Family Power, and even all the politicians who stay only for power. Keep only those who are loyal and ideologically committed. Listen to Tharoor, hold elections for the President. It will take time to reorganise Congress, but there still are 4 years until the next elections.
* This rant is long and tedious to read, but I urge you to pay heed to my two cents. We must remember that we are fighting an ideological enemy, years in the making, disciplined, trained and dreaming for this very moment for years. Protests are good, but we fail to understand one thing: even our protests lack a bit in secularity. True secularism comes from celebrating diversity, not repressing it under the guise of equality and irreligious temper. Through our protests, we must spread literacy, education, upliftment of the Depressed and Marginalised. We need to hit BJP below the belt: its Hindutva agenda that is blatantly upper-caste arrogant and bigoted.

TL:DR - Make Sachin Pilot the head of Congress and Shashi Tharoor in South India. We cannot fight unconstitutionalism with the same breed.",1584630787.0,"Makes sense. Congress needs major changes. They need to be in action. Every democracy needs a strong opposition. And yes, I agree with the focus on anti-terror activities and how the focus should be there. But with godi media and their presence, i am sure they will somehow make this also work from them. I have seen that happen with yes bank crisis- an issue which should have been one which could have made people look into how the defaulters are these big shots of media and parliament, but no. They just kept talking about the 1-2 crore painting  and the slip by RG in the number of defaulters. But that is just me being skeptical and cynical.  overall, I agree with you. And yes, the protesters need to understand how no issue is worth losing life for. If we are alive, we can continue fighting.[deleted]",CAA-NRC-NPR

On each of the following points we can make memes/detailed explanations and distribute on social media.

2. [Haren Pandya murder](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/haren-pandya-narendra-modi-murder-case-supreme-court) Haren Pandya was a popular leader of BJP in Gujarat and a potential rival of Modi. He was assassinated while he was on a morning walk. His security was mysteriously withdrawn by the Gujarat government headed by Modi just days before his murder.

Sanjiv Bhatt may or may not be innocent, but it is clear that  Modi can stoop to any level to ruthlessly destroy his opponents. Sanjiv Bhatt was sentenced for life in a 30 years old case.

1090,The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective,8,f96yyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f96yyo/the_problem_with_current_caa_protests_from_a/,133,"Note: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations. 

Thanks for your participation.",1582646515.0,"\#1 Solid proposal

There is already a solid proposal with centuries of theory and practice. It's called **investigations.** *<OMG frantic screaming. Such blasphemy!>* You know, like in any other crime. Do you go stand in queue and give alibi each time there's a murder in your area to prove you are **not** the murderer? The burden of proving a person is illegal immigrant should shift to the government. And indeed that was exactly how it was until BJP I drafted rules to shift it onto the person.

&#x200B;

\#2 Existing refugee system

Actually, we don't have a refugee law. Any person deemed illegal immigrant cannot get citizenship by naturalization - that's the wording of the Citizenship Act '55.

What we have is an SOP followed by MHA. An immigrant can claim they are a refugee fleeing persecution by showing proof. Then government carries out a case-by-case evaluation and either grants few of them a LTV (long term visa) or rejects. Those who get LTV are no longer labelled ""illegal immigrants"" and therefore become eligible for naturalization.

**If this system is good enough for you, then why do you require a CAA at all?**

Also, CAA protests are not about foreign muslim refugees. The protests are mainly about its planned use as a pincer movement to aid disenfranchisement of *Indian muslim citizens* through NRC. Have you Shah's chronology samajhlijiye?

In addition, they are also about the arbitrary exclusion based on religions, arbitrary date (which means even hindu refugees get denied) and arbitrariness of location (which means pre-2014 refugees who settled in NE get denied).

This is a good video by a lawyer on the many mismatches between its stated intentions and its wordings - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gifeGicNLfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gifeGicNLfI)

This is a good ELI5 video on the motivations behind these protests - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZSpqpfvQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4ZSpqpfvQs)

This is a good article on why idea of NRC itself is immoral - [https://thewire.in/rights/nrc-caa-assam-accord](https://thewire.in/rights/nrc-caa-assam-accord).The problem isn't with the nature of anti-CAA protestors or their tactics but the whole intention of the act. IF, it's a big IF, the govt genuinely cared about the sikhs and dalit hindus of pakistan and afghanistan who have come here before 2014 and wanted to give them citizenship, they could have done it in a minute in the existing form form of the CAA. All they had to do is expedite the process and voila, they all get citizenship. No harm no foul. There was zero need to link religion with citizenship or make them prove they were persecuted on the basis of their religion ( you ever sit down and think how those poor souls are going to prove that to a govt babu?). 

I say bring back ALL the hindus and sikhs from afghanistan, pakistan and bangladesh in first class flights and bring them here, like how the Israelis do, just don't fuck around with the muslims for shits and giggles while you are at it, no? Since you are a right-winger I am sure you will agree with me here.Firstly few points need to be cleared very well to everyone.

1. This CAA does nothing, I mean absolutely nothing for any minorities living in Pak, Afg, Ban right now, it's for those who are already here in India, so all this advertisement about how we are saving minorities in these countries is fake.

2. CAA is not exactly about giving exclusive citizenship, it's about fast tracking the process of getting citizenship for these people, they would have eventually gotten citizenship even without CAA but it would have taken longer, just like the muslim immigrants/refugees would also be able to get.

3. The opposition parties of our country are absolutely useless, they will walk out of the parliament and cry in front of the media, why the fuck are you even elected as MPs if you can't stay inside the parliament and oppose something you see is wrong, fuck with your cowardice way of protesting and giving up, losers.

4. Personally I hate absolutely everything where religion gets involved, I am not an atheist and that's why I don't like my religion getting dragged in these shits.
I am not a fan of using religion in any debate, argument, decision making and law making process.

5. I am a supporter of the idea of CAA, i.e. giving citizenship to the refugees and immigrants who deserves, I mean who are living here for long enough and can't have anywhere to go back to, I support the idea of giving them citizenship and let them and their childrens live a meaningful life where they will get the basic rights like education, healthcare etc.

Based on a vague complaint by an MLA. But an action which resulted in the actual demolition of housing (admittedly, slums - but housing nevertheless)

So the problem wasn't slums (which would've been a noble cause) - but slums occupied by perceived ""foreigners"" 

As of today, another politician has raised suspicion that a bunch of construction workers were foreigners - because he saw them eating ""poha"":

https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/bjp-leader-who-thinks-eating-poha-makes-one-bangladeshi-has-united-all-foodies-against-him-2471355.html

Poha. Please understand.... ""P.O.H.A"".....

So - clearly - there is no actual basis for these actions & statements. But houses *have been* damaged and lives have been disrupted.

Now - a lot of the affected folks *did* have proof in the form of Aadhar cards, PAN Cards. 

So imagine the state of the folks - who don't have the (right\any at all) paperwork. Those folks shall be thrown into detention centres:

But in a turn of events that not many are surprised by - the PM is straight up denying the very existence of such a detention centre:

The idea is - if such blatant lies & borderline fascism isn't stopped right away - it will keep growing and expanding and directly affecting more and more sections of the population.

One religious minority today, another tomorrow, backwards castes and tribes, sexual minorities and more.

So a protest was organized in San Francisco outside the Indian Consulate on 26th January against CAA,NRC and NPR. More than 400 people showed up but to our surprise the consulate was ready for protestors. They had made a small area with barricades around their building and hosted 25-30 people with pro-CAA placards. The people who were called by the consulate were highly abusive and provocative. The placards they were holding had words like ch\*\*tiya, pigs, calling us terrorists etc. They were also given a sound system to undermine our voices. It just broke my heart to see that these consulate people stooped to such low level.

These people would occasionally come out and enter anti CAA protestors and shouted Jai Shree Ram and hurled slurs at muslim people, called everyone Pakistani and went back to consulate premises.

However, my mother and her entire side of the family are hindutva believers, who are fervent and obdurate in their belief in a Hindu Rashtra. They constantly espouse and spout beliefs such as ""10 years till the Muslims kills us all"" and ""Muslims go against the fabric of India"" and ""All these Muslims want to establish a  Ghazwa-e-Hind"". 
I am at my wits' end battling their predisposed notions of Muslims, despite them all being highly educated members of society.

1094,The problem with the anti-CAA protests is the messaging adopted by the liberals and the leftists,87,eis5lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eis5lf/the_problem_with_the_anticaa_protests_is_the/,51,"The CAA is a mistake. That much is certain. But unfortunately some of the messaging I've seen seems to harp on the fact that the CAA and the NRC will somehow benefit Hindus while affecting Muslims, while this is not obvious and I don't know if it is true.   
  
The CAA is for Hindus/Jains/Buddhists/Parsis/Christians from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, right? So if the CAA is introduced, it would prevent Indian born Muslims from being able to establish their citizenship during the NRC, if the NRC is done stupidly like it was done in Assam. That much is clear. Then these Muslims would have to wait for 11 years to be able to apply for citizenship in India, in the meantime losing their assets and their right to work or free movement within India. That's fucked up. Almost everyone knows this. 
  
But if the NRC is introduced, that would also exclude *India* born Hindus who can't prove their citizenship from being able to apply for citizenship, right? So *India* born Hindus and other minorities like Sikhs or Parsis or Siddis can *also* get fucked, right? The CAA explicitly says it only accommodates for refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. If a hypothetical non-Muslim family cannot prove they are from India *or* the other 3 countries, they get fucked, right? What are they supposed to do? Forget the obvious examples of tribals or migrants. What is a family living in a MHADA compound in Mumbai supposed to do? What about Koli fishermen? 
  
So why are the anti-CAA protests revolving solely around how it will affect only Muslims? It will affect every single person in India. Even assuming a best case scenario and an error rate of just 5%, it will still affect 50 million people. It will affect everyone - not just Congress voters or ""libtards"" or ""sickulars"". It will affect bhakts also.   
  
Why are bhakts even supporting and defending this nonsense? They should be opposing this too, since (like DeMo) this will affect them a lot too. In fact, I now notice bhakts now criticizing DeMo when they blindly supported it in 2016.   
  
I predict they will begin criticizing CAA/NPR/NRC about CAA/NPR/NRC in a few years when some of their own citizenships come into question - because remember, depending on when the government sets the cutoff for NRC, we have to establish our citizenship to before that date by proving ""ancestry"" and not being perceived as a ""doubtful citizen"" : both these terms have no provision for legal documentation. How do I prove ancestry? What are ancestral documents?   
  
The BJP is arrogantly setting itself up for yet another clusterfuck purely motivated by 2 things: a hatred for Muslims, and the quest to plunder as much of India as possible. Remember, if we are declared ""doubtful"" citizens then while we are ""under trials"" to get on the NRC, the government can seize our assets as far as I know.  
  
Seriously it boggles my mind that bhakts who can also be affected by this issue are supporting it. This is not a Muslim vs Hindu or a liberal vs secular issue. This is a common sense vs brain dead arrogance issue. This is not a ""their side"" vs ""our side"" thing at all, even though the messaging has been about that. This potentially fucks every single Indian irrespective of political preferences, gender, ethnicity, caste or religion. Its complete madness.  
  
There are better ways to do this. I mena even the elections are done in a phased manner. If the BJP is desperate to root out illegal immigrants, then they should think 5000 times before putting a country through something that will fuck it raw again. 2016 was enough.",1577962321.0,"I am with kejriwal on this one.

It's is often said by sanghis who claim that 'Hindu khatre mein hain' and that india will become Muslim majority by 2050, however the reality is that even if Hindus do not have any children and if the Muslim population grows at a rate of 2% per year, the Muslim population will only be about 360 million(36 crore) and for the Muslim population to even reach the current level of hindu population it will take about 80 years growing at a constant rate of 2%.

This 2% isn't even their actual growth rate, it's even lesser.

In 1951 census, the population of India was 360.9 million(36.09 crore) out of which 303.6 million(30.36) was Hindu and Muslim was 35.4 million(3.54 crore), in 2011 census, the population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore)  of which hindu population was about 965.6 million(96.56 crore) and Muslim population was about 171.8 million(17.18 crore).

So this means, from 1951 to 2011 census, the contribution of population growth of Hindus is about 78% and Muslims is about 16%. So no, india is not going to be Muslim majority and taken over in 2050 or something along those lines, it is just fear mongering by sanghis.

Also since india became more developed compared to 1951, the fertility rate has come down across ALL religions. More developed areas have lower fertility rates in general.

Right now, democracy and economy are in danger.

Our GDP has been the lowest at 4.5% since the past 6 years. You can't have $5 trillion economy in 2024, if the economy is slowing down like this, we need a double digit growth to accomplish, yet since every quarter, the economic growth is sliding down.

Several sectors of the economy are experiencing negative growth. This [article](https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown) explains the problems pretty well and also talks about solutions.

As we also know democracy is also under threat, look what's happening in UP, Delhi and many other places, dissent is being shutdown. Many protesters are getting beaten, getting shot, some of them are getting killed. Dissent is also stopped by bringing internet shutdowns. India accounts for 67% of all internet shut downs, that happen across the world, the internet shutdowns in kashmir has been longer than 145 days, longest ever in a democracy. India has the most number of internet shutdowns in the world by far. India's rank in freedom of press index is dropping.

The opposition to CAA is being called 'anti-nationals' as usual. The CAA-NPR-NRC is deadly combo, it will have their way for a Hindu rastra and therefore it would be the end of a secular democracy. it will strip millions of Muslim of their citizenship. The financial cost of this will be insane.

The NRC in Assam costed about Rs. 1,220 crores which has a population of 30.6 million(3.06 crore) which is about 2.2% of india's population. Out of that, 1.9 million(19 lakh) were could'nt prove their citizenship. The cost of this would be Rs. 399 per person.

If we apply this to whole nation, whose population is 1.37 Billion(137 crore), it would be about Rs. 55,000 crore. Building one detension centre in Assam, which could detain about 3,000 people costed about Rs. 45 crore.

Detaining even 50 million(5 crore) people, this would cost about Rs. 7.5 lakh crore. For comparison total budgetary expenditure for health and education was Rs. 8.4 lakh crore in 2018-19.

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

From Jadavpur University to JNU, from Bengal to Kerela, it is the left that is on the streets. Kerela, as you know, was the first state to refuse implementation of the bill. They are now also the first state to go to Supreme Court against any Central govt law, for the first time in history.

In Bengal too, the Left Front parties were the first who started to protest against CAA (started since October 2019 against NRC). They were the first to protest against NPR and threatened to destroy detention centres if they are built forcibly. The bourgeois media (imcliding the likes of NDTV) focuses on TMC whose leaders have no problem meeting with the PM and continue the work of NPR, despite protests. They refuse to create a national front against CAA.

Left Front parties was the first alliance which sent letters to all the CMs requesting to not implement the CAA.  Despite potential risks of their only govt (Kerela) to be banished.

The Congress is uninterested in leading any serious movement against CAA. All they do is call some half-hearted meetings that no one attends. The states with Congress govt do not play a frontal role to lead the protests in their states.

The Right understands this well. You don't see Liberal organisations being attacked. It is the Left orgainsations and unions that are being attacked by the Right.

Still, the Liberal organisations are acting as if they are the one doing all work. Liberalism is the political wing of capitalism. It inherently leans rightward (since going left is opposing capitalism). Their enlightened centrist attitude (""both sides are wrong dude"") will never be able to remove the breeding grounds of fascism (which is capitalism). If we let Liberals act as if they are the saviours of India, fascism may eventually fall due to powerful protests, but its origin factors will never reduce. Neoliberalism will continue and eventually give rise to Fascism once more.",1579090490.0,"Ah yes, some half assed ""centrists are fascist enablers"" nonsense rhetoric to divide people fighting for a common cause.

1099,Kerala Chief Minister duty-bound to approach me: Governor Arif M. Khan,13,esfbrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/esfbrh/kerala_chief_minister_dutybound_to_approach_me/,5,"New Delhi: Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that the Constitution gives him many options and he will take a decision at an appropriate time on Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“As far as I am concerned, the rules of duties are clear. It is already established how the Chief Minister is supposed to approach me. The Chief Minister is duty-bound to approach me before he passes any such order. My role is to see that the state works according to the rules. I am not claiming supremacy,” he told The Sunday Guardian.

Khan said it was his duty to ensure that the rule, law and Constitution were followed in letter and spirit in the state. “Also, it is my responsibility to ensure that the Constitutional machinery does not collapse,” he said.

“Be you ever so high, the law is above you. You have to respect the law. Once the President has given assent to a law, as Governor, I have the right to protect it. I am moving in a Constitutional way. I am not a rubber stamp,” said the Kerala Governor.

The plea filed by the Kerala government under Article 131 of the Constitution on disputes between Centre and states, stated that the CAA violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, right to life under Article 21 and freedom to practice religion under Article 25. The Kerala Assembly also passed a resolution earlier demanding scrapping of the CAA, claiming that the Act, which was passed after following due process by Parliament, was unconstitutional.

Saying that “dissent is the essence of democracy”, Khan cited the Constitution to accuse the Pinarayi Vijayan government of violating the law on key issues like passing a resolution or challenging the CAA in the Supreme Court, without keeping him in the loop.

“I have no problem with the government, Opposition, or anybody holding a different view on CAA, NRC (National Register of Citizens) or NPR (National Population Register). Everyone is free. But my only point is the rules should be followed as stipulated by the Constitution,” he said.",1579743545.0,"Bigot, hypocrite, boot licker....“A resolution which demands the scraping of an unconstitutional law in itself is Unconstitutional”.
